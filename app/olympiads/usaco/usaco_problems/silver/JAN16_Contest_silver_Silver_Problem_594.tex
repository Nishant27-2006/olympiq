\section*{Problem Statement}

Bessie the cow has designed what she thinks will be the next big hit video game:
"Angry Cows".  The premise,  which she believes is completely original, is that
the player shoots cows with a slingshot into a one-dimensional scene consisting
of a set of hay bales located at various points on a number line. Each cow lands
with sufficient force to detonate the hay bales in close proximity to her
landing site.  The goal is to use a set of cows to detonate all the hay bales.

There are $N$ hay bales located at distinct integer positions
$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N$ on the number line.  If a cow is launched with power $R$
landing at position $x$, this will causes a blast of "radius $R$", destroying
all hay bales within the range $x-R \ldots x+R$.  

A total of $K$ cows are available to shoot, each with the same power $R$. Please
determine the minimum integer value of $R$ such that it is possible to use the $K$ cows
to detonate every single hay bale in the scene.

INPUT FORMAT (file angry.in):
The first line of input contains $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 50,000$) and $K$
($1 \leq K \leq 10$).  The remaining $N$ lines all  contain integers
$x_1 \ldots x_N$ (each in the range
$0 \ldots 1,000,000,000$).

OUTPUT FORMAT (file angry.out):
Please output the minimum power $R$ with which each cow must be launched in order
to detonate all the hay bales.
