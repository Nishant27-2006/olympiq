\section*{Problem Statement}

The long road through Farmer John's farm has $N$ crosswalks across it,
conveniently numbered $1 \ldots N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100,000$).   To allow cows to
cross at these crosswalks, FJ installs electric crossing signals, which light up
with a green cow icon when it is ok for the cow to cross, and red otherwise. 
Unfortunately, a large electrical storm has damaged some of his signals.  Given
a list of the damaged signals, please compute the minimum number of signals that
FJ needs to repair in order for there to exist some contiguous block of at least
$K$ working signals.

INPUT FORMAT (file maxcross.in):
The first line of input contains $N$, $K$, and $B$ ($1 \leq B, K \leq N$).  The
next $B$ lines each describe the ID number of a broken signal.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file maxcross.out):
Please compute the minimum number of signals that need to be repaired in order
for there to be a contiguous block of $K$ working signals somewhere along the
road.
