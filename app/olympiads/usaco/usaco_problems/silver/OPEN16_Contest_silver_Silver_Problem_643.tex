\section*{Problem Statement}

Bessie the cow, always a fan of shiny objects, has taken up a hobby of mining
diamonds in her spare time!  She has collected $N$ diamonds ($N \leq 50,000$) of
varying sizes, and she wants to arrange some of them in a pair of 
display cases in the barn.  

Since Bessie wants the diamonds in each of the two cases to be relatively similar in 
size, she decides that she will not include two diamonds in the same case if their sizes
differ by more than $K$ (two diamonds can be displayed together in the same case if
their sizes differ by exactly $K$).  Given $K$, please help Bessie determine the
maximum number of diamonds she can display in both cases together.

INPUT FORMAT (file diamond.in):
The first line of the input file contains $N$ and $K$ ($0 \leq K \leq 1,000,000,000$).
The next $N$ lines each contain an integer giving the size of one of the 
diamonds.  All sizes will be positive and will not exceed $1,000,000,000$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file diamond.out):
Output a single positive integer, telling the maximum number of diamonds that 
Bessie can showcase in total in both the cases.
