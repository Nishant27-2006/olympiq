\section*{Problem Statement}


Bessie has an $N\times N$ ($1\le N\le 1000$) addition table where the integer in
the cell at row $r$ and column $c$ is $r+c$, for all $1\le r,c\le N$. For
example, for $N=3$, the table would look like this:


2 3 4
3 4 5
4 5 6

Unfortunately, Elsie got ahold of the table and permuted it by performing the
following three types of operations as many times as she wanted.

Swap two rowsSwap two columnsSelect two values $a$ and $b$ that are both present in the table, then
simultaneously change every occurrence of $a$ to $b$ and every occurrence of $b$
to $a$.
Elsie will always perform operations in increasing order of type; that is, she
performs as many operations as she likes (possibly none) first of type $1$, then
of type $2$, and finally of type $3$.

Help Bessie recover a possible state of the table after Elsie finished applying
all of her operations of types $1$ and $2$, but before applying any operations
of type $3$. There may be multiple possible answers, in which case you should
output the lexicographically smallest one.

To compare two tables lexicographically, compare the first entries at which they
differ, when reading both tables in the natural order (rows from top to bottom,
left to right within a row).

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$.

The next $N$ lines each contain $N$ integers, representing Bessie's addition
table after Elsie has permuted it.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
The lexicographically minimum possible state of the table after all operations
of types 1 and 2, but before any operations of type 3. It is guaranteed that the
answer exists.

SAMPLE INPUT:
1
2
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
2

Regardless of what operations Elsie performs, the table won't change.

Here is a possible sequence of operations Elsie might have performed.


2 3 4
3 4 5
4 5 6
-> (op 1: swap columns 2 and 3)
2 4 3
3 5 4
4 6 5
-> (op 1: swap columns 1 and 2)
4 2 3
5 3 4

-> (op 3: swap values 2 and 3)
4 3 2
5 2 4
6 4 5
-> (op 3: swap values 3 and 4)
3 4 2
5 2 3
6 3 5

Note: the following is also a possible state of the table after operations of
types 1 and 2, but it is not the lexicographically smallest because the second
entry of the first row is larger than in the correct answer.
