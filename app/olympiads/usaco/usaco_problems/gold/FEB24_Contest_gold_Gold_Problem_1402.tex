\section*{Problem Statement}


Farmer John's $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 5 \cdot 10^5)$ cows are lined up in a circle.
The $i$th cow has a bucket with integer capacity $a_i$ $(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9)$
liters. All buckets are initially full.

Every minute, cow $i$ will pass all the milk in their bucket to cow $i+1$ for
$1\le i<N$, with cow $N$ passing its milk to cow $1$. All exchanges happen
simultaneously (i.e., if a cow has a full bucket but gives away $x$ liters of
milk and also receives $x$ liters, her milk is preserved). If a cow's total milk
ever ends up exceeding $a_i$, then the excess milk will be lost.

After each of $1, 2, \dots, N$ minutes, how much total milk is left among all
cows?

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$. 

The next line contains integers $a_1,a_2,...,a_N$.


OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output $N$ lines, where the $i$-th line is the total milk left among all cows
after $i$ minutes.

Initially, the amount of milk in each bucket is $[2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1]$.
After $1$ minute, the amount of milk in each bucket is $[1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1]$
so the total amount of milk is $8$.After $2$ minutes, the amount of
milk in each bucket is $[1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]$ so the total amount of milk is
$7$.After $3$ minutes, the amount of milk in each bucket is
$[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ so the total amount of milk is $6$.After $4$
minutes, the amount of milk in each bucket is  $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ so the total
amount of milk is $6$.After $5$ minutes, the amount of milk in each
bucket is $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ so the total amount of milk is $6$.After $6$ minutes, the amount of milk in each bucket is $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$
so the total amount of milk is
$6$.
