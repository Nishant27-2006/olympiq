\section*{Problem Statement}

Bessie has been playing the popular fighting game Moortal Cowmbat for a long
time now. However, the game developers have recently rolled out an update that
is forcing Bessie to change her play style.

The game uses $M$ buttons labeled by the first $M$ lowercase letters
($1 \leq M \leq 26$).  Bessie's favorite combo of moves in the game is a
length-$N$ string $S$ of button presses ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$).  However, due to
the most recent update, every combo must now be made from a series of "streaks",
where a streak is defined as a series of the same button pressed  at least $K$
times in a row ($1 \leq K \leq N$). Bessie wants to modify her favorite combo to
produce a new combo of the same length $N$,  but made from streaks of button
presses to satisfy the change in rules.

It takes $a_{ij}$ days for Bessie to train herself to press button $j$ instead
of  button $i$ at any specific location in her combo (i.e. it costs $a_{ij}$ to
change a single specific letter in $S$ from $i$ to $j$).  Note that it might
take less time to switch from using button $i$ to an intermediate button $k$ and
then from  button $k$ to button $j$ rather than from $i$ to $j$ directly (or
more generally, there may be a path of changes starting with $i$ and ending with
$j$ that gives the best overall cost for switching from button $i$ ultimately to
button $j$).

Help Bessie determine the smallest possible number of days she needs to create a
combo that supports the new requirements.

SCORING:
Test cases 2-4 satisfy $N\le 1000, K\le 50.$Test cases 5-8 satisfy
$N\le 30,000, K\le 50.$ 

INPUT FORMAT (file cowmbat.in):
The first line of input contains $N$, $M$, and $K$. The second line contains
$S$, and the final $M$ lines contain an $M\times M$ matrix of values  $a_{ij}$,
where $a_{ij}$ is an integer in the range $0 \ldots 1000$ and $a_{ii} = 0$ for
all $i$.  

OUTPUT FORMAT (file cowmbat.out):
Output a single number, representing the minimum number of days Bessie needs to
change her combo into one that satisfies the new requirements.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5 5 2
abcde
0 1 4 4 4
2 0 4 4 4
6 5 0 3 2
5 5 5 0 4
3 7 0 5 0
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
5

The optimal solution in this example is to change the a into b, change the d into e, and then
change both e’s into c’s. This will take $1+4+0+0=5$ days, and the final
combo string will be bbccc.
