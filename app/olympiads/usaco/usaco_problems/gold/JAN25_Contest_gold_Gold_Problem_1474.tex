\section*{Problem Statement}


Consider an undirected graph with $N$ nodes labeled $1\dots N$ and $M$ edges
($1\le N\le 2\cdot 10^5, 0\le M\le 4\cdot 10^5$). You're given a binary string
$s_1s_2\dots s_N$. At time $t$ for each $t\in [1,N]$, 

If $s_t=0$, node $t$ is removed from the graph.If $s_t=1$, node $t$ is removed from the graph, and edges are added between
every pair of neighbors that node $t$ had just before removal.
Note that in both cases, when a node is removed from the graph all of its
incident edges are removed as well.

Count the number of pairs of nodes that can reach each other via some sequence
of edges just before each of timesteps $1\ldots N$.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$ and $M$.

The second line contains the bit string $s$ of length $N$.

The next $M$ lines each contain two integers denoting an edge of the graph.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
$N$ lines, the number of pairs before each timestep.

SAMPLE INPUT:

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

Before any removals, all pairs of nodes are reachable from each other. After
node $1$ is removed, an edge is added between $2$ and $3$, so they can still
reach each other.
