\section*{Problem Statement}

Farmer John's largest pasture can be regarded as a large 2D grid of square
"cells" (picture a huge chess board).  Currently, there are $N$ cows occupying
some of these cells ($1 \leq N \leq 200$).  

Farmer John wants to build a fence that will enclose a square region of cells;
the square must be oriented so its sides are parallel with the $x$  and $y$
axes, and it could be as small as a single cell.  Please help him count the
number of distinct subsets of cows that he can enclose in such a region.  Note
that the empty subset should be counted as one of these.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains a single integer $N$.  Each of the next $N$ lines Each
of the next $N$ lines contains two space-separated integers,  indicating the
$(x,y)$ coordinates of a cow's cell.  All $x$ coordinates are distinct from
each-other, and all $y$ coordinates are distinct from each-other.  All $x$ and
$y$ values lie in the range $0 \ldots 10^9$.

Note that although the coordinates of cells with cows are nonnegative, the 
square fenced area might possibly extend into cells with negative coordinates.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
The number of subsets of cows that FJ can fence off. It can be shown that this
quantity fits within a signed 32-bit integer.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
0 2
2 3
3 1
1 0
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
14

In this example, there are $2^4$ subsets in total. FJ cannot create a fence enclosing only cows 1
and 3, or only cows 2 and 4, so the answer is $2^4-2=16-2=14$.

SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
420

SCORING:
In test cases 1-5, all coordinates of cells containing cows are less than
$20$.In test cases 6-10, $N\le 20$.In test cases 11-20, there are no additional constraints.
