\section*{Problem Statement}


Farmer John is training to become forklift certified! As part of his training,
he needs to clear $N$ ($1 \le N \le 10^5$) boxes, conveniently labeled $1$
through $N$, from an old warehouse.

The boxes can be modeled as axis-aligned rectangles in a 2-dimensional plane,
where the $+x$-direction is east and the $+y$-direction is north. Box $i$ has
its southwest corner at $(x_{i1},y_{i1})$ and its northeast corner at
$(x_{i2},y_{i2})$. All coordinates are integers in the range $[1, 2N]$, and no
two corners from two different rectangles share the same $x$ or $y$ coordinate.
All boxes have a non-zero area, and no two boxes intersect.

Farmer John plans to remove the boxes one at a time out of the southwest
entrance of the warehouse. However, he can only remove a box if no part of any
other box lies both south and west of the box's northeast corner due to physical
limitations of the forklift.

An example with $N=4$ is shown below. To remove box $4$, there cannot be any
other boxes in the shaded region. Boxes $2$ and $3$ prevent box $4$ from being
removed, but box $1$ does not.


Help Farmer John decide how to remove all the boxes! Your code should operate in
two separate modes, defined by an integer flag $M$:
Mode 1 ($M = 1$): Generate a permutation of $1, \dots, N$ specifying
a valid box removal order. If there are multiple valid orders, find any. It can
be proven that such an order always exists.Mode 2 ($M = 2$): For each $k = 1, \dots, N$, output $\texttt{1}$ if
Farmer John can remove box $k$ if boxes $1, \dots, k - 1$ have already been
removed, and $\texttt{0}$ otherwise.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
Each input consists of $T$ ($1 \le T \le 10$) independent test cases. It is
guaranteed that the sum of all $N$ within each input does not exceed
$5 \cdot 10^5$.

The first line of input contains $T$ and $M$. (Note that $M$ is the same for
each test case.) Each test case is then formatted as follows:
The first line contains a single integer $N$.Each of the next $N$
lines contains four space-separated integers $x_{i1}, y_{i1}, x_{i2}, y_{i2}$:
the locations of the southwest and northeast corners of box $i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
For each test case:
If $M = 1$, output a single line with $N$ space-separated integers, where
the $j$-th integer is the label of the $j$-th box to remove.If
$M = 2$, output a single line with a binary string of $N$ characters specifying
the answer for each $k = 1, \dots, N$.

The first test case corresponds to the $N = 4$ example above. Box $1$ is not
blocked by anything, box $3$ is blocked by box $1$, box $2$ is blocked by box
$3$, and box $4$ is blocked by boxes $2$ and $3$.

For the first test case, box $2$ is blocked by box $3$, so Farmer John cannot
remove it before removing box $3$.

SCORING:
Inputs 3-5: $M = 1$, $N\le 1000$.Input 6: $M = 2$,
$N \le 1000$.Inputs 7-13: $M = 1$, no additional constraints.Inputs 14-16: $M = 2$, no additional constraints.
