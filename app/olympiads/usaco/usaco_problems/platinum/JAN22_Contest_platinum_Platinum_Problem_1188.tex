\section*{Problem Statement}

Bessie is bored and yet again causing trouble in Farmer John's barn. FJ has $N$
($1\leq N \leq 10^5$) stacks of haybales. For each $i\in [1,N]$, the $i$th stack
has $h_i$ ($1\le h_i\le 10^9$) haybales. Bessie does not want any haybales to
fall, so the only operation she can perform is as follows:

If two adjacent stacks' heights differ by at most $K$ ($1\le K\le 10^9$),
she can swap the two stacks.

What is the lexicographically minimum sequence of heights that Bessie can obtain
after some sequence of these operations?

**Note: the time and memory limits for this problem are 4s and 512MB, twice
the defaults.**
INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains $N$ and $K$. The $i+1$-st line contains the
height of the $i$-th haybale.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Please print out $N$ lines, the $i$-th containing the height of the $i$-th
haybale in the solution.

One way that Bessie can swap the stacks is as follows:


   7 7 3 6 2
-> 7 7 6 3 2
-> 7 7 6 2 3
-> 7 6 7 2 3
-> 6 7 7 2 3

SCORING:
In 10% of all input cases, $N\le 100$In another 20% of all input cases, $N\le 5000$In the remaining 70% of input cases, there are no additional
constraints
