(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )
<p>Suppose that Farmer John doesn&apos;t remove any cows from the line. Then we can
simply simulate the actions of the cows in order, keeping track of which boxes
of cereal are left. This yields an <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> solution to the original problem:
for each <span class='math'>$i$</span>, simulate the last <span class='math'>$N-i$</span> cows.
<p>There are several ways to speed up this solution. One way is to start with
<span class='math'>$i = N$</span> and add cows one by one. Suppose we have solved the problem for the last
<span class='math'>$N-i$</span> cows: that is, if the last <span class='math'>$N-i$</span> cows line up in order, we know which box
each cow takes. We want to efficiently update this outcome to the outcome if
instead the last <span class='math'>$N+1-i$</span> cows were to line up. Thus, we need to handle the
operation &quot;add cow to front of line&quot;. 
<p>Suppose the new cow has preferences <span class='math'>$(f, s)$</span>. Then the new cow will certainly
get cereal <span class='math'>$f$</span>. If the last <span class='math'>$N-i$</span> cows didn&apos;t take cereal <span class='math'>$f$</span>, then nothing will
change: all of those cows have the same outcomes after adding the new cow. But
if some cow <span class='math'>$j$</span> had taken cereal <span class='math'>$f$</span>, then after adding the new cow, <span class='math'>$j$</span> no
longer gets <span class='math'>$f$</span>. If <span class='math'>$f$</span> is <span class='math'>$j$</span>&apos;s second choice, then now <span class='math'>$j$</span> gets nothing---and
all other cows have the same outcomes. If <span class='math'>$f$</span> is <span class='math'>$j$</span>&apos;s first choice, and her
second choice was taken by some cow earlier in line, then again <span class='math'>$j$</span> gets
nothing, and all other cows have the same outcome. But if <span class='math'>$j$</span>&apos;s second choice
was not taken by some cow earlier in line, then <span class='math'>$j$</span> will take it. Unfortunately,
this case may cause a cascade: we need to recurse on <span class='math'>$j$</span> and figure out whether
<span class='math'>$j$</span> stole her second-choice cereal from someone later in line, and so forth.
<p>At each step of the recursion, a cow <span class='math'>$j$</span> can only &quot;steal&quot; from one later cow:
the cow who originally took the cereal which <span class='math'>$j$</span> is now taking. So the above
algorithm doesn&apos;t blow up exponentially or anything. But each addition of a new
cow seems like it could cause a recursion of depth <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span>, which would imply an
overall time complexity of <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span>!
<p>Fortunately, this is not the case: we can show that the sum of the recursion
depths is actually <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span>. The reason is that every time we recurse, a cow is
either kicked from first-preference to second-preference or from
second-preference to nothing. Moreover, as we add cows, the reverse can never
happen: a cow who was getting nothing cannot suddenly get something when we add
a cow to the front of the line. It follows that the total depth of all the
recursion is at most <span class='math'>$2N$</span>.
<p>To implement the algorithm efficiently (with a constant-time update at each
recursion step) we just need to keep track of which cow currently gets each box
of cereal (<span class='math'>$occ[pos]$</span> stores the index of the cow that gets cereal <span class='math'>$pos$</span>). The final algorithm runs in time <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span>. See my code below:
<p><pre class='prettyprint'>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
using namespace std;
#define MAXN 100001

int N,M;
int f[MAXN], s[MAXN];
int occ[MAXN];
int ans[MAXN];

int main()

	int cnt = 0;
	for(int i=N;i&gt;=1;i--)
	{
		int j = i;
		int pos = f[i];
		while(1)
		{
			if(occ[pos] == 0)
			{
				occ[pos] = j;
				cnt++;

			}
			else if(occ[pos] &lt; j)
				break;
			else
			{
				int k = occ[pos];
				occ[pos] = j;
				if(pos == s[k])
					break;
				j = k;
				pos = s[k];
			}
		}
		ans[i] = cnt;
	}
