(Analysis by Brandon Wang)
<p>First, we describe how to deal with the layovers.  They can be ignored for
airport 1, since Bessie can access any flight leaving airport 1. For any other
airport <span class='math'>$i$</span>, Bessie can access a flight leaving <span class='math'>$i$</span> at time <span class='math'>$r$</span>  if and only if
she can get to airport <span class='math'>$j$</span> by time <span class='math'>$r - a_i$</span>. Thus, we can decrement all such
<span class='math'>$r$</span>&apos;s by <span class='math'>$a_i$</span>.
<p><strong>Subtask 1: <span class='math'>$r_j &lt; s_j$</span></strong>
<p>For this subtask, note that Bessie can use flight <span class='math'>$j$</span>  if and only if she can
get to airport <span class='math'>$c_j$</span> at or before <span class='math'>$r_j$</span>,  which must be done using earlier
flights. So, we can just iterate through the flights in increasing order of
<span class='math'>$r_j$</span>,  and maintain the earliest possible arrival time at each airport.
<p>This takes <span class='math'>$O(M\log M + N)$</span>.
<p><strong>Subtask 2: <span class='math'>$M, N \leq 5000$</span></strong>
<p>For this subtask, we use a Bellman-Ford like algorithm. Specifically, to relax
an edge corresponding to flight <span class='math'>$j$</span>, we just check if it is possible to arrive
at airport <span class='math'>$c_j$</span> at or before <span class='math'>$r_j$</span>, and if so, we update the earliest possible
arrival time at airport <span class='math'>$d_j$</span>.
<p>Since the optimal path uses at most <span class='math'>$M$</span> edges (there is never any use for Bessie
to take the same flight twice), this can be done in <span class='math'>$O(M^2 + N)$</span>.
<p><strong>No further constraints</strong>
<p>For a complete solution, we combine ideas from both subtasks. Note that since
Bessie never takes the same edge twice, we never actually need to relax along an
edge twice, since the second time we update the arrival time at <span class='math'>$d_j$</span> there will
be no improvement.
<p>Thus, if we update the arrival time at airport <span class='math'>$i$</span> from <span class='math'>$t_i$</span> to <span class='math'>$t_i&apos;$</span>, we only
need to relax edges <span class='math'>$j$</span> such that <span class='math'>$c_j = i$</span> and <span class='math'>$t_i&apos; \leq r_j &lt; t_i$</span>. In
particular, if we maintain a queue of edges that need to be relaxed,  and a
sorted list of flights leaving each airport in increasing order of departure
time, then each edge relaxation step only takes <span class='math'>$O(f)$</span> time, where <span class='math'>$f$</span> is the
number of new flights that  are added to the queue. Since each edge is added to
the queue at most once, the total runtime of all the edge relaxations would just
be <span class='math'>$O(M)$</span>. So, the total runtime would be <span class='math'>$O(M\log M + N)$</span>, where <span class='math'>$O(M\log M)$</span>
comes from sorting the flights departing each airport.
<p>Python implementation:

N, M = input().strip().split()

    # relax this edge
    time[d] = min(time[d], s)
    # check if any new edges need to be relaxed, and add them to the queue if so
    while idx[d] &lt; len(flights[d]) and flights[d][idx[d]][0] &gt;= s:
        q.append(flights[d][idx[d]])
        idx[d] += 1
    qid += 1

    if time[i] != INFTY:
        print(time[i])
