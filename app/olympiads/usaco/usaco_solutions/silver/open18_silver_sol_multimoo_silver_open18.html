(Analysis by Brian Dean)
<p>This problem is an exercise in recursive (depth first) searching to identify the
connected components in a graph.  
<p>The first task is much simpler than the second.  We make a graph where every
cell is a node, and two adjacent cells are connected with an edge if they
contain the same number.  We then launch a recursive &quot;flood fill&quot; from every
cell (skipping the ones already visited) that fans out to label every connected
region while adding up its size.  My code below actually does something slightly
different -- but ultimately equivalent -- by building a separate graph for each
distinct ID number and then recursively searching through all of these (this 
allows me to re-use most of the code I wrote for the first task for the second
task).
<p>For the second task, we build a graph for every pair of cows <span class='math'>$(x,y)$</span> where the
nodes are the regions we computed in the first task, and the edges connect 
adjacent regions where one is labeled by cow <span class='math'>$x$</span> and the other by cow <span class='math'>$y$</span>.  Each
node in this graph is given a &quot;size&quot; which is the same as the corresponding
region size from the first task.  We then launch a recursive flood fill on each
of these graphs to find whichever one has the largest region.  
<p>There are two important ideas to employ here in order to make our solutions run 
quickly.  One is to make sure each region from the first task gets compressed to
a  single node in the second task.  If we don&apos;t do this, then in the second task
we might end up recursively scanning through the same large region over and
over, wasting considerable time.  The other idea is that when we do our
recursive searching, we need to be sure the running time only depends on the
number of edges in the graph, not the number of nodes, since each of the <span class='math'>$(x,y)$</span>
pairwise graphs for the second task involves a large number of nodes but likely
very few edges.  For example, we would not want to keep an array of &quot;have I been
there&quot; flags for every node, which is  initialized to false for each recursive
search.  Instead, in the solution below, we use a map data structure for this
purpose, which only creates flags as they  are needed, avoiding the
initialization of flags for nodes that ultimately end up not being relevant.
<p>My code is below.  (it&apos;s a bit on the terse side, though, so if anyone has
alternative solutions that are cleaner to look at please feel welcome to send
them my way  to see if they are better suited for use as a model solution).
