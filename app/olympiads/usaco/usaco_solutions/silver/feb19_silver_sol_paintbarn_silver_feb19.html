(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>The most naive approach to this problem is to simulate applying
each coat of paint and then looking at each <span class='math'>$1 \times 1$</span> square to
see if it has the right number of coats of paint applied. This
approach should get around half credit.
<p>Let us imagine solving the one-dimensional variant of this problem,
where we have a fence and can apply coats of paint to some subintervals
<span class='math'>$[l_i, r_i]$</span> of the fence. Imagine that we actually had <span class='math'>$N$</span> paint cans
and put each can at the location <span class='math'>$l_i$</span> that corresponded to where it started,
and we also noted at each location <span class='math'>$r_i$</span> where to stop carrying cans of paint
with us. If we then walk along the fence and pick up and drop off cans of paint,
at each location in the fence we can count how many coats of paint we would use
by counting how many cans of paint we are carrying.
<p>In terms of how to implement this, we can enumerate, for each location, how many
cans of paint we&apos;re picking up and how many cans of paint we&apos;re dropping off. Note,
therefore, that the number of coats of paint that are used at location <span class='math'>$x$</span> is equal
to the sum of the changes in number of coats of paint that take place over all locations
from the beginning to <span class='math'>$x$</span>. This technique is often referred to as computing a prefix sum,
as we start with an array and then compute the sum of every prefix of the array to get
the final result we want.
<p>To apply this to two dimensions, imagine that we take the roof and break it up
into 1000 sections, each of which is one-dimensional. We can apply this technique
to each section and then sum the results. Code for this is as follows:
<p><pre class='prettyprint'>
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;

using namespace std;

int dp[1000][1001];

int main() {
  freopen(&quot;paintbarn.in&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, stdin);
  freopen(&quot;paintbarn.out&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, stdout);
  int n, k;
  cin &gt;&gt; n &gt;&gt; k;
  while(n--) {
    int a, b, c, d;
    cin &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b &gt;&gt; c &gt;&gt; d;
    for(int i = a; i &lt; c; i++) {
      dp[i][b]++;
      dp[i][d]--;
    }
  }
  int ret = 0;
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j &lt; 1000; j++) {
      if(dp[i][j] == k) ret++;
      dp[i][j+1] += dp[i][j];
    }
  }
  cout &lt;&lt; ret &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre>
<p>We can do better though - there&apos;s no reason that prefix sums only have to
work in one dimension! If we have a two-dimension array <span class='math'>$g$</span> and then define
<span class='math'>$f(i, j)$</span> to be the sum of all <span class='math'>$g(k, l)$</span> where <span class='math'>$k \le i$</span> and <span class='math'>$l \le j$</span>, then
we can define <span class='math'>$f(i, j) = g(i, j) + f(i-1, j) + f(i, j-1) - f(i-1, j-1)$</span>,
and after computing the two-dimension prefix sums, we can iterate over all
elements to compute the desired area.
