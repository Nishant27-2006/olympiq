(Analysis by Nick Wu)

Unlike with the bronze version of this problem, we cannot naively simulate removing
every lifeguard and seeing what duration of time is still covered.

There are only

$2N$

points of interest - namely, every point in time where some
lifeguard starts working or when some lifeguard stops working. We'll start by sorting
all of them and processing the events in order.

Maintain a set of lifeguards that are known to be working. If some lifeguard is working,
then track how much time any lifeguard is working. If exactly one lifeguard is working,
track that this is time that will be lost if that lifeguard gets fired. Then, update
the set of working lifeguards appropriately.

Afterwards, see which lifeguard has the minimum amount of time spent working alone,
and subtract that from the total amount of time any lifeguard is working to get the answer.
