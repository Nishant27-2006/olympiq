(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )
<p>Sort the citation counts largest-to-smallest, and consider a bar graph where bar
<span class='math'>$i$</span> has width <span class='math'>$1$</span> and height <span class='math'>$c_i$</span>. The <span class='math'>$h$</span>-index of the papers before the
surveys is simply the dimension of the largest square that fits under this bar
graph. We want to determine how much we can increase the <span class='math'>$h$</span>-index with <span class='math'>$K$</span>
surveys each citing <span class='math'>$L$</span> distinct papers.
<p>Let&apos;s binary search on the final <span class='math'>$h$</span>-index. Then we just need a way to check
whether it&apos;s possible to achieve a given <span class='math'>$h$</span>-index <span class='math'>$h$</span>.
<p>It&apos;s clearly optimal to work only with the <span class='math'>$h$</span> papers that start off with the
largest citation counts. Note that we have <span class='math'>$KL$</span> total citations to allocate to
these papers. If the total citation count of these papers is less than
<span class='math'>$h^2 - KL$</span>, then we cannot hope to achieve <span class='math'>$h$</span>. This is one failure mode.
<p>Unfortunately, it&apos;s not the only failure mode. That is, the converse of the
above statement is not true, because we have an added restriction that no survey
can cite a paper twice. So for example if <span class='math'>$h=3$</span>, <span class='math'>$K = 1$</span>, and <span class='math'>$L = 2$</span>, and the
top three papers initially have citation counts <span class='math'>$(3, 3, 1)$</span>, then we cannot
raise the third paper to citation count <span class='math'>$3$</span> since we only have one survey. This
illuminates another possible failure mode: if there is a paper with less than
<span class='math'>$h-K$</span> citations initially, then we cannot achieve <span class='math'>$h$</span>.
<p>It turns out that these are the only two failure modes. We can prove this by
induction on <span class='math'>$K$</span>. If <span class='math'>$K=0$</span> then every paper already has at least <span class='math'>$h$</span> citations,
so we&apos;re certainly happy. Suppose <span class='math'>$K&gt;0$</span>. Every paper needs at most <span class='math'>$K$</span> more
citations. There is some set of papers which need exactly <span class='math'>$K$</span> more citations. By
the assumption on the sum of citation counts, this set has size at most <span class='math'>$L$</span>, so
with one survey we can cite all these papers (plus some others, until we&apos;ve hit
<span class='math'>$L$</span> citations or this survey has cited every paper). Now we&apos;re in a situation
with <span class='math'>$K-1$</span> remaining surveys, but every paper needs at most <span class='math'>$K-1$</span> more
citations. Moreover, it can be checked that the total number of needed citations
is now at most <span class='math'>$(K-1)L$</span>. So we can indeed induct, completing the proof.
<p>Below is Danny Mittal&apos;s code, implementing the above idea.

            long needed = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; mid; j++) {
                needed += (long) Math.max(0, mid - publications[j]);
            }
            if (needed &lt;= ((long) k) * ((long) l) &amp;&amp; publications[mid - 1] + k &gt;= mid) {
                lower = mid;
            } else {
                upper = mid - 1;
            }
        }
