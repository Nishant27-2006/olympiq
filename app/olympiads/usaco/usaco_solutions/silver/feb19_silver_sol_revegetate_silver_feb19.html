(Analysis by Brian Dean)
<p>Imagine forming a graph (a network) of all the cows, with two cows linked 
together with edges labeled &quot;S&quot; or &quot;D&quot;.  Our goal is to count the number of
connected components, <span class='math'>$K$</span>, in this graph, and then two also figure out if each
component can be labeled with 1&apos;s and 2&apos;s in a consistent way that respects all
of the &quot;S&quot; and &quot;D&quot; edges within the component.  If labeling each component is
possible, the answer is <span class='math'>$2^K$</span>, since note that we can reverse the labeling of
any component (toggle 1s to 2s and vice versa) to  produce another valid
labeling; so each component can be labeled in exactly 2 ways.  Conveniently, <span class='math'>$2^K$</span>
in binary is a 1 followed by <span class='math'>$K$</span> zeros.
<p>In my code below, I use a recursive &quot;depth first&quot; search to solve both of the
problems above.  I scan all the nodes of the graph and upon finding one that
isn&apos;t labeled yet, I launch a recursive search from that point, which fans out
and visits every node within its connected component, labeling nodes with 1s and
2s along the way in a consistent manner.  If it ever discovers an inherent
inconsistency (two 1s connected with a &quot;D&quot; edge or a 1 and 2 connected by an &quot;S&quot;
edge), it flags the solution as being impossible.  
<p>If you are interested in related problems, this is quite similar to the problem
of testing if a graph is &quot;bipartite&quot; --- colorable with just 2 colors so that no
two connected nodes have the same color (in fact, if all the edges are &quot;D&quot;
edges, then this problem is exactly the problem of testing bipartiteness).  It&apos;s
also related to the &quot;2SAT&quot; problem --- setting variables in a boolean expression
like (x OR y) AND (not(x) OR y) AND (z OR not(y)) to either true or false so 
the entire expression evaluates to true.  The reason it&apos;s called &quot;2SAT&quot; is that
the expression must consist of &quot;clauses&quot; that are all ANDed together (so we need
to satisfy all of them to satisfy the overall expression), where each clause is
an OR of two things (a variable or its negation).  To solve a problem like this,
observe that each clause turns into an &quot;S&quot; or &quot;D&quot; edge between two variables.
<p>Here is my code.  The label <span class='math'>$L[x]$</span> of node <span class='math'>$x$</span> is zero if we haven&apos;t visited the
node yet, or else 1 or 2.
