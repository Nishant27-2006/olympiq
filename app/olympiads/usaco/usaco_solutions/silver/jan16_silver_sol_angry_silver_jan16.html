(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>In this problem, we have several hay bales on the number line and a few
exploding cows. We can send an exploding cow to a certain location on the line
and it will cause all the hay bales to explode within a given radius. We want to
figure out the smallest radius that the cows can explode at so that we can force
all the hay bales to explode.
<p>Note that if there is some radius <span class='math'>$r$</span> such that it is possible for all hay bales
to explode, then all the hay bales will explode for any radius <span class='math'>$R &gt; r$</span>.
Therefore, we can binary search for the minimum radius <span class='math'>$r$</span>.
<p>To check if a given radius <span class='math'>$r$</span> is feasible, consider the leftmost hay bale at
location <span class='math'>$x$</span>. We have to place a cow somewhere between <span class='math'>$x-r$</span> and <span class='math'>$x+r$</span> in order
to make that hay bale explode. To make as many other hay bales explode, it makes
sense to move the cow to the right as much as possible, because there are no hay
bales to the left of <span class='math'>$x$</span> so shifting the cow to the right can only include more
hay bales. Therefore, we would have the hay bale explode at location <span class='math'>$x+r$</span> and
all hay bales in between <span class='math'>$x$</span> and <span class='math'>$x+2r$</span> explode. We can then find the leftmost
hay bale that is at location greater than <span class='math'>$x+2r$</span> and repeat this process, then
count the number of cows that we placed. If the number of cows used is less than
or equal to <span class='math'>$K$</span>, then <span class='math'>$r$</span> is feasible. Otherwise, the answer must be at least
<span class='math'>$r+1$</span>.
<p>Here is my Java code demonstrating this.
