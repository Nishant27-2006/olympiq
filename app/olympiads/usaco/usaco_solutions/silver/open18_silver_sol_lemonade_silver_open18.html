(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )
<p>This problem immediately seems to be looking for a greedy solution. There are
two obvious greedy orderings: sort the cows by increasing <span class='math'>$w_i$</span>, or sort the
cows by decreasing <span class='math'>$w_i$</span>.
<p>Trying both orderings, it turns out that sorting the cows from largest <span class='math'>$w_i$</span> to
smallest <span class='math'>$w_i$</span> is provably optimal. There are several ways to show this. One way
is to consider any ordering in which the <span class='math'>$w_i$</span> are not ordered
largest-to-smallest, and show that swapping two out-of-order cows will improve
the solution or leave it the same.
<p>Here is a slightly cleaner proof. We do not explicitly show that the above
ordering is optimal, but this can be deduced from the properties we do prove
about the ordering. 
<p>Given any ordering, we can shuffle the cows who do not join the line to the end
of the ordering -- and they will still not join the line in this new ordering.
So there is an optimal ordering in which all cows who join the line precede all
cows who do not join the line. Now consider any cow <span class='math'>$i$</span> who does join the line,
and any cow <span class='math'>$j$</span> who does not join the line. If <span class='math'>$w_i &lt; w_j$</span>, we can swap cows <span class='math'>$i$</span>
and <span class='math'>$j$</span>, and cow <span class='math'>$j$</span> will join the line but cow <span class='math'>$i$</span> will not. So in some optimal
ordering, the cows who join the line have the <span class='math'>$k$</span> largest <span class='math'>$w_i$</span> for some
<span class='math'>$k \leq N$</span>.
<p>Now, the optimum is at most <span class='math'>$k$</span> if and only if <span class='math'>$w_{k+1} &lt; k$</span>, where <span class='math'>$w_{k+1}$</span> is the waiting time of the <span class='math'>$(k+1)^\text{st}$</span> cow after sorting largest-to-smallest. This gives our algorithm: after sorting the cows from largest <span class='math'>$w_i$</span> to smallest <span class='math'>$w_i$</span>,
we can simply scan through the cows for the first <span class='math'>$k$</span> such that <span class='math'>$w_{k+1} &lt; k$</span>.
