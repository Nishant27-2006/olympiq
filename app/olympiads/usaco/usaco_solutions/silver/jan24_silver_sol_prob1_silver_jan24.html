(Analysis by Suhas Nagar and Anand John)
<p>For the interested reader, this problem draws inspiration from the
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem'>Secretary Problem</a>. In
terms of this problem, each one of Farmer&apos;s John&apos;s memories can be viewed as the
following: If Farmer John were to uniformly reject the first <span class='math'>$a_i$</span> cows, and
then choose the first cow he saw that was better than any cow he had seen
before, he would choose the <span class='math'>$h_i$</span>-th cow.
<p><strong> Subtask 1: </strong>
<p>We can solve this with brute force. Simply iterate through all possible
sequences of cowmpetency scores and return the first one that satisfies Farmer
John&apos;s memories.
<p>Code:
<pre class='prettyprint'>
def genarray(i, N, C, curscores):
    if curscores[i] != 0:
        if i == N: yield curscores
        else: yield from genarray(i + 1, N, C, curscores)
    else:
        for score in range(1, C + 1):
            curscores[i] = score
            if i == N: yield curscores
            else: yield from genarray(i + 1, N, C, curscores)
        curscores[i] = 0

t = int(input())

for test in range(t):
    N, Q, C = map(int, input().strip().split())
    c = [0] + [*map(int, input().strip().split())]
    constraints = [[*map(int, input().strip().split())] for _ in range(Q)]
    for curscores in genarray(1, N, C, c):
        for [a, h] in constraints:
            if max(curscores[: a + 1]) != max(curscores[:h]) or \
                curscores[h] &lt;= max(curscores[: a + 1]):
                break
        else:
            print(*curscores[1:])
            break
    else:
        print(-1)
</pre>
<p><strong>Subtask 2:</strong>
<p>Let us now define <span class='math'>$B(k)$</span> to be the index of the first cow with a strictly larger
score than the first <span class='math'>$k$</span> cows. This is useful because each of Farmer John&apos;s
memories can be fully described by the statement: <span class='math'>$B(a_i) = h_i$</span>.
<p>Based on this and the above brute force, we realize that possible sequences only
satisfy Farmer John&apos;s constraints if, for every <span class='math'>$1 \leq i \leq N$</span>:
<ol><li><span class='math'>$\max\limits_{1 \leq j \leq i}{c_j} = \max\limits_{1 \leq j &lt; B(i)}{c_j}$</span>
</li><li>
<span class='math'>$c_{B(i)} &gt; \max\limits_{1 \leq j \leq i} c_j$</span>
</li></ol>
<p>This leads us to the following observation: For all <span class='math'>$1 \leq i &lt; j &lt; B(i)$</span>:
<span class='math'>$B(i) = B(j)$</span>. Therefore, if there exists <span class='math'>$i,j$</span> such that <span class='math'>$a_i &lt; a_j &lt; B(a_i)$</span>
and <span class='math'>$B(a_i) \neq B(a_j)$</span> then there does not exist a sequence in accordance with
Farmer John&apos;s memory. Combining these observation, with the given <span class='math'>$(a_i, h_i)$</span>
pairs,  we can derive the value <span class='math'>$B(j)$</span> for any <span class='math'>$j$</span> that satisfies the inequality
<span class='math'>$a_i \leq j &lt; h_i$</span> for some <span class='math'>$i$</span>. For all the other values of <span class='math'>$j$</span> we will call
<span class='math'>$B(j)$</span> unknown
<p>This is enough information to come up with a greedy solution. We will iterate
through <span class='math'>$i$</span>  from <span class='math'>$1$</span> to <span class='math'>$N$</span>. At each point, we will store the minimum possible
values <span class='math'>$c_1 \dots c_n$</span> that satisfy the constraints related to
<span class='math'>$B(1) \dots B(i)$</span>. This means that all values of <span class='math'>$c_i$</span> that were not given are
initially set to <span class='math'>$1$</span> since this is the minimum possible.
<p>At a certain <span class='math'>$i$</span>, if <span class='math'>$B(i)$</span> is unknown then no change will be made to the array
since there are no associated constraints with <span class='math'>$B(i)$</span>. Otherwise, there are two
cases:
<ol><li><span class='math'>$\max\limits_{1 \leq j \leq i}{c_j} = \max\limits_{1 \leq j &lt; B(i)}{c_j}$</span>:
We can see that this applies no additional constraint to <span class='math'>$c_i$</span> so we do not have
to change it. There is an associated change with <span class='math'>$c_{B(i)}$</span> which we&apos;ll discuss
after the next case.
</li><li>Otherwise we have:
<span class='math'>$\max\limits_{1 \leq j \leq i}{c_j} &lt; \max\limits_{1 \leq j &lt; B(i)}{c_j}$</span>. In
this case we need to find a <span class='math'>$j \leq i$</span> and set <span class='math'>$c_j$</span> to
<span class='math'>$\max\limits_{1 \leq \ell &lt; B(i)}{c_\ell}$</span>.  <span class='math'>$j$</span> needs to be as large as
possible such that <span class='math'>$c_j$</span> was not given in the problem and there exists no <span class='math'>$k$</span>
such that <span class='math'>$k \leq j$</span> and <span class='math'>$B(k) &lt; B(i)$</span>. The reasoning behind the first part is
simple, we&apos;re trying to find the lexographically minimum sequence. So if we have
to increase some <span class='math'>$c_j$</span>, we want to pick as large of a <span class='math'>$j$</span> as possible. The
reason for the second part is the following: if we were to change <span class='math'>$c_j$</span> and such
a <span class='math'>$k$</span> existed, we would have to satisfy
<span class='math'>$\max\limits_{1 \leq \ell &lt; B(i)}{c_\ell} = c_j &lt; c_{B(k)} \leq  \max\limits_{1 \leq \ell &lt; B(i)}{c_\ell}$</span>.
This is clearly not possible. Therefore, if no such <span class='math'>$j$</span> exists,  a sequence is
impossible to construct.</li></ol>
<p>For both of these cases, we also need to ensure that
<span class='math'>$c_{B(i)} &gt; \max\limits_{1 \leq j \leq i} c_j$</span>. If <span class='math'>$c_{B(i)}$</span> is not given, then
we can set <span class='math'>$c_{B(i)} = \max\limits_{1 \leq j \leq i} c_j + 1$</span>. This is the
smallest possible value. If <span class='math'>$c_{B(i)}$</span> was given, we need to make sure that it
is at least this value, otherwise, no sequence is possible.
<p>The reason this algorithm works is that each additional constraint that is added
can only result in an equivalent or larger lexicographic sequence. Therefore, by
making changes as far back in the array as possible, the resulting sequence is
the lexicographically minimum one.
<p>To finish, it&apos;s now simple to iterate through the sequence and ensure that all
the values are at most <span class='math'>$C$</span> to check if the last constraint in the problem is
satisfied.

<p><strong>Subtask 3</strong> In this case, we have to optimize the two <span class='math'>$O(n^2)$</span> parts of our
solution. The first part, filling in known values of <span class='math'>$B$</span> can be solved using two
pointers. To optimize the greedy algorithm we can notice that all values <span class='math'>$j$</span>
where <span class='math'>$i \leq j &lt; B(i)$</span> satisfy <span class='math'>$B(i) = B(j)$</span>. Therefore, once you satisfy the
constraint associated with <span class='math'>$B(i)$</span>, the ones associated with
<span class='math'>$B(i+1) \dots B(B(i)-1)$</span> are redundant so we can skip them. Putting this
together, we get an algorithm that runs in <span class='math'>$O(n)$</span>.
