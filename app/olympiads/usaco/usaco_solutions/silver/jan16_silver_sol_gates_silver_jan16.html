(First Solution Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>In this problem, Farmer John is building a fence on a 2D grid. He wants to count the number of gates
he needs to build in order to make sure that he can travel from any location on the farm to any other one.
Gates are necessary to cross between two squares which are separated by a fence.
<p>Because the fence is small, we can build the fence directly and then count the number of distinct
regions Farmer John&apos;s farm is broken up into, say using a "floodfill" approach. If it is broken up into <span class='math'>$N$</span> distinct regions, then
Farmer John needs to build <span class='math'>$N-1$</span> gates, since a gate can only connect make it possible to travel
between two regions.
<p>In terms of storing the fence, we opt to use a two-dimensional array of booleans to track which locations
have fence built on them. Instead of having fence pieces be unit length, we double the length of the fence.
Therefore, distinct squares of the fence are at points <span class='math'>$(x, y)$</span> where both <span class='math'>$x$</span> and <span class='math'>$y$</span> are odd, and to
check if there is a fence between those two points, you simply inspect the point in between.
<p>Here is my Java code demonstrating this.

(Alternative Solution Analysis by Lazar Ilic)

<p>In this problem, Farmer John creates a number of discrete regions in
his farm. Adding a gate between two previously disconnected regions
will combine them so the number of regions will be reduced by
one. Thus the total number of gates needed is the number of initially
disconnected regions minus one. It is important we note that the
region outside all the fences counts as a region: indeed if there were
no fenced in region we would need no gates, if we had one fenced in
region we would need one gate, etc. As it happens there is a result on
planar graphs called Euler's formula which states that $v-e+f=2$, where
$v$, $e$, and, $f$ are the number of vertices, edges, and faces (regions)
respectively. Furthermore the end state of the farm will be a planar
graph where fences are edges and endpoints of fences are vertices
since, by definition, no two fences will intersect at any point that
is not a vertex. So, in our problem we want to find $f-1=e-v+1$. This
enables us to cast the problem as one of vertices and edges instead of
faces. Indeed all that remains is for us to count the number of
distinct vertices and edges. In the code below I used the HashSet to
avoid redundancies and used a few variables to keep track of the $(x,y)$
values of the current point where Farmer John resides and of the
previous point. Then we add the vertex and the edge (where each is a
uniquely defined string with edges are composed of the vertices
ordered in terms of their South/West to North/East ends) and move
along through the loop.
