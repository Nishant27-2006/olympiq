(Analysis by Mark Chen)

For any set of points P, the minimum area of an enclosing rectangle with sides
parallel to the x and y axes is equal to the product of the difference between
the largest and smallest x-coordinates in P and the difference between the
largest and smallest y-coordinates in P. For a proof sketch, note that the
projection of any such rectangle onto the x-axis must contain the interval [min
x-coordinate in P, max x-coordinate in P], or it cannot have contained all
points in P.

Now consider the four largest x-coordinates (allowing repeats) over all points
in P. After we remove at most 3 points, the resulting largest x-coordinate must
be one of these four values. Similarly, after we remove at most 3 points, there
are only four possible values for the smallest x-coordinate, the largest
y-coordinate, and the smallest y-coordinate.

Since there are just four candidates for each side of the new rectangle, there
are at most $4^4 = 256$ possible rectangles that could result from removing 3
points! For each candidate rectangle, we iterate through all points in P to
count how many points lie outside of it. If this count is less than or equal to
3, we have a valid rectangle, and should compute its area. The final answer is
the minimum of all valid rectangle areas.
