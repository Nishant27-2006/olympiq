(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )

This problem can be solved with flood fill. We loop over all ice cream cells,
and depth-first search or breadth-first search to label the entire blob
containing the cell. Ordinarily this would take

$O(N^4)$

time, since each search
could take

$O(N^2)$

time and we perform

$O(N^2)$

searches. However, if a cell
has already been visited by a previous search (i.e. it is in the same component
as a previously seen cell) then we can skip it, since the cells in its component
have already been labelled. Thus, every cell is only visited once, so the
complexity of all the searches together is only

$O(N^2)$

, which runs in time.

Now each ice cream cell is labelled with a "blob ID". Now we need to find the
area and perimeter of each blob. Area is simply the number of cells labelled
with this ID, and the perimeter is the sum over all cells in the region of the
number of "border edges" of that cell: that is, the number of empty-space cells
adjacent to that ice cream cell.

Hence, we can initialize the area and perimeter of each region to zero, and
compute them incrementally by making a final pass over the grid.

Once all areas and perimeters are computed, it is a simple matter to find the
largest area, and among those blobs with largest area, find the smallest
perimeter.
