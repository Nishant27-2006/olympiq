(Analysis by Richard Qi) 
<p>Denote <span class='math'>$A$</span> as the number we start with and <span class='math'>$B$</span> as the number we want to turn <span class='math'>$A$</span>
into. 
<p><strong>Observation 1:</strong> The answer is always <span class='math'>$\mathcal O(\log{\max(A, B)})$</span>. 
<p>To see why this is the case, we first prove that we can turn <span class='math'>$A$</span> into <span class='math'>$1$</span> using
<span class='math'>$\mathcal O(\log{A})$</span> operations.
<p>Observe the binary representation (base 2) of <span class='math'>$A$</span>.  If <span class='math'>$A$</span> is a power of two,
then clearly we can just do dividing operations and reduce it to <span class='math'>$1$</span> quickly.
Otherwise, if the last bit is <span class='math'>$0$</span>, do a dividing operation; if the last bit is a
<span class='math'>$1$</span>, do a plus followed by a dividing operation. This reduces the number of bits
in the binary representation of <span class='math'>$A$</span> by <span class='math'>$1$</span>. Thus, either <span class='math'>$A$</span> is a power of two
and we do <span class='math'>$\mathcal O(\log{A})$</span> dividing operations, or we do a maximum of <span class='math'>$2$</span>
operations to reduce the number of bits in the binary representation of <span class='math'>$A$</span> by
<span class='math'>$1$</span>. Since there are only <span class='math'>$\mathcal O(\log{A})$</span> total bits in <span class='math'>$A$</span>, this takes 
<span class='math'>$\mathcal O(\log{A})$</span> operations in total.
<p>For the case of turning <span class='math'>$1$</span> into <span class='math'>$B$</span>, note that if we take the inverse of all
operations, this is equivalent to turning <span class='math'>$B$</span> into <span class='math'>$1$</span> using &quot;subtract 1&quot; and
dividing operations. By a similar argument as above, if the last bit of <span class='math'>$B$</span> is a
<span class='math'>$0$</span>, we can divide by <span class='math'>$2$</span>, otherwise we can subtract one and then divide by <span class='math'>$2$</span>.
This takes <span class='math'>$\mathcal O(\log{B})$</span> operations to turn <span class='math'>$B$</span> into <span class='math'>$1$</span>, so it takes
<span class='math'>$\mathcal O(\log{B})$</span> operations to turn <span class='math'>$1$</span> into <span class='math'>$B$</span> using addition and
multiplication operations.
<p>Thus, it takes <span class='math'>$\mathcal O(\log{A}+\log{B})$</span> operations to turn <span class='math'>$A$</span> into <span class='math'>$1$</span>,
and then turn <span class='math'>$1$</span> into <span class='math'>$B$</span>, so the answer is always
<span class='math'>$\mathcal O(\log{\max(A, B)})$</span>.
<p><strong>Observation 2:</strong> There is never a division that takes place after a
multiplication operation. Intuitively, any <span class='math'>$1$</span>s that we add in between a
multiplication and division operation would be more efficiently moved after the
division operation.
<p>We will prove this via proof by contradiction: suppose there is a division
operation that takes place after a multiplication operation. Then, in the middle
of the sequence of operations, we have <span class='math'>$\cdots *, +^{k}, / \cdots$</span>, where <span class='math'>$*$</span>
denotes a multiplication operation, <span class='math'>$+^{k}$</span> denotes <span class='math'>$k \geq 0$</span> addition
operations, <span class='math'>$/$</span> denotes a division operation, and the <span class='math'>$\cdots$</span> indicate
operations occurring before and after this subsequence of operations.
<p>Now, because a division operation was used, and the number after the <span class='math'>$*$</span>
operation was even, the number of <span class='math'>$+$</span> operations in between is even. Suppose we
replaced this subsequence of operations with <span class='math'>$\cdots +^{k/2} \cdots$</span>. Let the
number starting the subsequence be <span class='math'>$x$</span>; in the first version of the sequence of
operations, we have <span class='math'>$x \implies 2x \implies 2x+k \implies x+k/2$</span>, while in the
second version of the sequence of operations, we have <span class='math'>$x \implies x+k/2$</span>.
<p>Since <span class='math'>$+^{k/2}$</span> is always less operations than <span class='math'>$*, +^{k}, /$</span> and both
subsequences correspond to the same function, the second subsequence never
appears in an optimal solution.
<p>Thus, we have proven that there is never a division that takes place after a
multiplication operation, so  the multiplication/division operations are of the
form <span class='math'>$/, /, /, \cdots *, *, *$</span>, with some number of addition operations added in
between every two division/multiplication operations. We can divide the
operations into <span class='math'>$3$</span> phases: the subsequence consisting of the last division
operation and everything before it, the subsequence consisting of the addition
operations after the last division and before the first multiplication, and the
subsequence consisting of the first multiplication operation and everything
after it. We label these subsequences <span class='math'>$S_1, S_2, S_3$</span>.
<p>These observations are good enough for partial credit. Suppose that we have
found all numbers <span class='math'>$x$</span> such that we need exactly <span class='math'>$k$</span> operations to turn <span class='math'>$A$</span> into
<span class='math'>$x$</span>, and suppose we have already done this for all <span class='math'>$k&apos; \leq k$</span>.  Then, we can
find all numbers <span class='math'>$y$</span> such that we need exactly <span class='math'>$k+1$</span> operations to reach <span class='math'>$y$</span>
from <span class='math'>$A$</span>, as each of these <span class='math'>$y$</span> must be a previous <span class='math'>$x$</span> value after a
division/multiplication/addition operation is applied. Additionally, each of
these <span class='math'>$y$</span> should be numbers that could not have been reached using <span class='math'>$k$</span> or less
operations.
<p>It turns out that for the subtask, if we only consider small values of <span class='math'>$x$</span> and
<span class='math'>$y$</span> in the above algorithm, we arrive at the correct answer. In other words,
when turning <span class='math'>$A$</span> into <span class='math'>$B$</span>, the intermediate numbers do not get larger than
<span class='math'>$10^5+\mathcal O(\log{A}+\log{B})$</span>. The first and second observations mentioned
above imply this, because during <span class='math'>$S_1$</span>, the only way we can increase is through
<span class='math'>$+$</span> operations (but there are only a small number of total operations), and
during <span class='math'>$S_2$</span> and <span class='math'>$S_3$</span>, the number only increases, until it arrives at
<span class='math'>$B \leq 10^5$</span>. Additionally, from the first observation, we only need to
consider values of <span class='math'>$k \leq \mathcal O(\log{\max(A, B)})$</span>, which allows us to
calculate the values of <span class='math'>$y$</span> from the values of <span class='math'>$x$</span> in linear time for each value
of <span class='math'>$k$</span>.
<p>Depending on implementation, this approach can be either
<span class='math'>$O(\max(A, B)\log{\max(A, B)})$</span> or <span class='math'>$O(\max(A, B))$</span>.
<p><strong>Observation 3:</strong> Just before a division operation, and just after a
multiplication operation, there is at most one addition operation. &quot;Just before&quot;
a division operation means before the division operation but after the previous
division operation (if such a division operation exists); &quot;just after&quot; is
defined similarly for multiplication.
<p>We prove this for division (the proof for multiplication is similar). Suppose
that we have a subsequence <span class='math'>$\cdots +^{2}, /, \cdots$</span>. Then, we can replace this
with <span class='math'>$\cdots /, +, \cdots$</span>, as both subsequences represent the function
<span class='math'>$x \implies x/2+1$</span>.
<p>(Although not needed for this problem, this observation actually implies that
when turning <span class='math'>$A$</span> into <span class='math'>$B$</span>, the intermediate numbers do not get larger than
<span class='math'>$10^5$</span>, which means in the brute force solution mentioned above, we could have
only considered numbers <span class='math'>$\le 10^5$</span>. The reason for this is that during <span class='math'>$S_1$</span>, the
sequence consists of <span class='math'>$/$</span> or <span class='math'>$+/$</span> subsequences concatenated together. In <span class='math'>$/$</span> and
<span class='math'>$+/$</span>, the original number cannot increase. Thus, the only way that an
intermediate number is larger than <span class='math'>$A$</span> is immediately after the first <span class='math'>$+$</span>
operation, which only happens if <span class='math'>$A$</span> is odd. So, all intermediate numbers are
<span class='math'>$\leq 10^5$</span>.)
<p><strong>Observation 4:</strong> If we fix the total number of divisions as <span class='math'>$D$</span>, then the
sequence <span class='math'>$S_1$</span> is fixed, and if we fix the total number of multiplications as
<span class='math'>$M$</span>, then the sequence <span class='math'>$S_3$</span> is fixed. 
<p>We prove the first part of the statement (the second part is very similar).
Suppose we make <span class='math'>$D$</span> divisions in <span class='math'>$S_1$</span>. Consider the first division; if <span class='math'>$A$</span> is
odd, then we must have added one before dividing (we could not have added more
by the result of our third observation). If <span class='math'>$A$</span> is even, then we could not have
added anything before dividing, as we cannot add more than <span class='math'>$1$</span> by the third
observation, and if we add exactly one, we cannot divide by <span class='math'>$2$</span>. Now, let the
value of the number after the first division be <span class='math'>$A_2$</span>.  We now know that we need
to transform <span class='math'>$A_2$</span> into <span class='math'>$B$</span> using exactly <span class='math'>$D-1$</span> divisions, so we can repeat the
argument we just made. Repeating this down to <span class='math'>$D=0$</span>, we arrive at a forced
sequence of operations in <span class='math'>$S_1$</span> given the value of <span class='math'>$D$</span>.
<p>Similarly, given <span class='math'>$M$</span>, we can arrive at a forced sequence of operations in <span class='math'>$S_3$</span>.
<p>Since the total number of operations is <span class='math'>$O(\log{\max(A, B)})$</span>, we can iterate
over all pairs of values for <span class='math'>$D$</span> and <span class='math'>$M$</span> and generate the forced sequences <span class='math'>$S_1$</span>
and <span class='math'>$S_3$</span>, which then force the number of addition operations that need to be in
<span class='math'>$S_2$</span>. Thus, given <span class='math'>$D$</span> and <span class='math'>$M$</span>, we can generate the entire sequence, count the
number of operations used, and record the minimum such number of operations.
<p>Depending on implementation, this is <span class='math'>$O(\log^3{\max(A, B)})$</span> or
<span class='math'>$O(\log^2{\max(A, B)})$</span>, both of which fit comfortably in the time limit.
<p>In the below implementation, the outer loop &quot;removed&quot; represents the number of
multiplications <span class='math'>$M$</span> in <span class='math'>$S_3$</span>, which fixes the number <span class='math'>$B&apos;$</span> that should be reached
before applying the sequence of operations in <span class='math'>$S_3$</span>. The inner while loop
represents increasing the value of <span class='math'>$D$</span> until the value of <span class='math'>$A$</span> after applying the
operations in <span class='math'>$S_1$</span> becomes less than or equal to <span class='math'>$B&apos;$</span>.
<p>Instead of directly simulating the process of generating the operations in
<span class='math'>$S_3$</span>, the number of such operations can immediately be determined by looking at
the binary representation of <span class='math'>$B$</span> and counting the number of bits in the last <span class='math'>$M$</span>
bits of the binary representation <span class='math'>$B$</span>. In particular, the number of additions in
<span class='math'>$S_3$</span> is equal to the number of <span class='math'>$1$</span> bits in the number <span class='math'>$B\&amp;(2^{M}-1)$</span>, where
<span class='math'>$\&amp;$</span> denotes bitwise AND.
