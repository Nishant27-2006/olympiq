(Analysis by Benjamin Qi)
<p>Consider an undirected graph with a vertex for every distinct ID that appears in
the input. Draw an edge (possibly a self-loop) between every two vertices whose
labels sum to <span class='math'>$A$</span> or <span class='math'>$B$</span>. Then cows can only be paired if their vertices are
connected by an edge, and every vertex is incident to at most two distinct
edges. For each edge, we need to choose some non-negative number of pairs to
form along it such that no ID is used more times than it appears.
<p>Graph Theory Definitions: We say that
<ul><li>A vertex is <em>incident</em> to an edge if the edge has the vertex as one of
its endpoints.</li><li>Two distinct edges are <em>adjacent</em> if they are
incident to a common vertex.</li></ul>
<p><div class='prob-section'><h4>Subtask 1:</h4>
If <span class='math'>$A=B$</span>, then no two edges are adjacent.  So for each edge we should form as
many pairs as possible using it.
<p><ul><li>Edges connecting <span class='math'>$(x,y)$</span> with <span class='math'>$x\neq y$</span> add <span class='math'>$\min(cnt[x],cnt[y])$</span>, where
<span class='math'>$cnt[x]$</span> denotes the number of cows with id <span class='math'>$x$</span>.</li><li>Edges connecting
<span class='math'>$(x,x)$</span> add <span class='math'>$cnt[x]/2$</span>.</li></ul>
<p>This runs in <span class='math'>$O(N\log N)$</span> if a sorted map is used.

<p><div class='prob-section'><h4>Full Solution:</h4>
Suppose there is a vertex <span class='math'>$x$</span> incident to only one edge <span class='math'>$e$</span>, with opposite
endpoint <span class='math'>$y$</span>. If <span class='math'>$x=y$</span>, then as in subtask 1 we must form as many pairs with
this edge as possible since it is adjacent to no other edges. Otherwise, this
edge could be adjacent to a different edge <span class='math'>$e&apos;$</span>, and forming an additional pair
with <span class='math'>$e$</span> might prevent the formation of an additional pair with <span class='math'>$e&apos;$</span>. However,
it does not hurt to form as many pairs using <span class='math'>$e$</span> as possible, since each
additional pair formed using <span class='math'>$e$</span> prevents the formation of at most one other
pair. After doing this, no additional pairs can be formed with <span class='math'>$e$</span>, and <span class='math'>$e$</span> may
be removed from the graph.
<p>It turns out that as long as we repeat the procedure above while possible, we
will end up removing all edges from the graph (see the end of the analysis for
why). 
<p>To simulate this efficiently, we can maintain a list of vertices that might be
incident to exactly one edge. While the list is  nonempty, we can remove its
last element, and if this element is incident to exactly one edge,  apply the
procedure above and append <span class='math'>$y$</span> to the list.
<p>The runtime is <span class='math'>$O(N\log N)$</span>, which is the same as the previous subtask.
Solutions with an additional factor of <span class='math'>$N$</span> could receive partial credit.

<p><div class='prob-section'><h4>Why are all edges removed?</h4>
We want to show that if the graph contains an edge, then there is a vertex
incident to exactly one edge. When <span class='math'>$A=B$</span> no vertex is incident to more than one
edge, so the conclusion is trivial. 
<p>It remains to consider <span class='math'>$A\neq B$</span>. Every vertex in the graph incident to at least
one edge must be incident to either one or two edges. Suppose there is a vertex
<span class='math'>$x$</span> incident to two edges (one corresponding to summing to A, and the other
corresponding to summing to B).  Then let&apos;s construct a walk by traversing a
type-A edge, then a type-B edge, then a type-A edge, and so forth. This walk
will eventually terminate at some vertex incident to exactly one edge. or it
would run indefinitely. However, the latter case is impossible since then it
would traverse infinitely many distinct vertices (<span class='math'>$x, x+B-A, x+2(B-A), \dots $</span>),
contradicting the graph having finite size.
