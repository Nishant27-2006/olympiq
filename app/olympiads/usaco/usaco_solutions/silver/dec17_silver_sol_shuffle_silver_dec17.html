If, in the shuffle, there is some position that won&apos;t receive any cows, then that position
will contain no cows after one shuffle. However, given that that position will contain no cows,
it is possible that the position reachable from that one in one shuffle could end
up containing no cows, and this effect can cascade through the positions.
<p>In general, if all of the positions that direct a cow to position <span class='math'>$p$</span> are known to eventually
contain no cows, then position <span class='math'>$p$</span> will also not contain any cows.
<p>We start by keeping track of, for every position
<span class='math'>$p$</span>, how many positions there are which still could contain cows forever
and direct them to position <span class='math'>$p$</span> after exactly one shuffle. After we&apos;ve computed these
quantities, we start a queue of positions which are now known never to contain any cows
after some number of shuffles. Any such position cannot contribute cows to the position
it directs to, so we need to decrement the counter for that position and possibly
enqueue it. We&apos;ll keep processing positions in the queue until it&apos;s empty, and
the answer is the number of elements which were never enqueued.
