(Analysis by Brian Dean)
<p>Let&apos;s first look at this puzzle without the one exceptional cow, to try and gain
an  understanding of when it is solvable and when it isn&apos;t.  It helps to think
of a minimal example that is not solvable, which turns out to be:
<p><pre>
11
10
</pre>
<p>Here, we are switching to 0s and 1s instead of Ls and Rs for convenience.  If
you think about this example for a few moments, you notice that no matter how
many times you toggle rows and columns, there will always be 3 of one bit and 1
of the other --- it is never  possible to make all four bits agree.  
<p>In fact, this ends up being the only bad structure that can prevent us from
solving the puzzle.  If we have any four bits that are corners of a rectangle
where three of the four agree (let&apos;s call this a &quot;bad rectangle&quot;), then the
puzzle is not solvable, and this is for the same reason as above, since  exactly
three of the four bits will always agree no matter what rows and columns we
toggle.  This condition, which persists throughout the toggling of rows and
columns, is called an &quot;invariant&quot;, and many times when you see  unsolvable
puzzles like this, it helps to try and find some sort of invariant that 
prevents solution of the puzzle.  
<p>Suppose now that there aren&apos;t any bad rectangles.  Let&apos;s try to make the entire
grid into 0s as follows: for any 1 in the top row, flip its entire column.  Then
for any 1 in the left row, flip its entire row.  This transforms the top row and
left column into all 0s.  If all the other entries are 0s, we are done.
Otherwise, if there is a 1 somewhere, this in combination with the top row and
left column forms a bad rectangle, which we had assumed could not exist.  Hence,
the puzzle is actually solvable if and only if there is no bad rectangle.
<p>The insight above is now enough to add back the one exceptional cow.  Let&apos;s 
proceed as before to set the top row and left column to all zeros.  If the
remaining elements are all 1s, then the top-left element was the exceptional
cow.  If any row or column is filled with 1s (except the first element, which we
have set to zero), then its first element is the exceptional cow.  Otherwise,
there should be a single 1 somewhere in the grid, which indicates the position
of the exceptional cow.
<p>My code in C++ is below.
