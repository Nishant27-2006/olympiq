(Analysis by Benjamin Qi)
<p>Given an input string <span class='math'>$s$</span> and an output string <span class='math'>$t$</span>, construct a directed graph
on vertex set <span class='math'>$\{\texttt{a}\dots\texttt{z}\}\cup \{\texttt{A}\dots\texttt{Z}\}$</span>.
For every two characters <span class='math'>$x$</span> and <span class='math'>$y$</span>, add a directed edge from <span class='math'>$x$</span> to <span class='math'>$y$</span>  if
there exists at least one index <span class='math'>$i$</span> such that <span class='math'>$s_i=x$</span>  and <span class='math'>$t_i=y$</span>.
<p>First, let&apos;s figure out when it is impossible to transform <span class='math'>$s$</span> into <span class='math'>$t$</span>. If
there is a vertex in our directed graph with more than one out-edge, the answer
is <span class='math'>$-1$</span>. The answer is also <span class='math'>$-1$</span> whenever <span class='math'>$s\neq t$</span> and <span class='math'>$t$</span> contains all <span class='math'>$52$</span>
distinct characters; any replacement will cause <span class='math'>$s$</span> to contain fewer than <span class='math'>$52$</span>
distinct characters.
<p>In all other cases, it is possible to transform <span class='math'>$s$</span> to <span class='math'>$t$</span>. A single keystroke
allows us to take any edge <span class='math'>$x\to y$</span> and replace it with an edge <span class='math'>$z\to y$</span> as long
as <span class='math'>$z$</span> does not have out-degree greater than one afterward. Any keystroke can
remove at most one edge from our directed graph, so the number of required
keystrokes is at least the number of edges in the directed graph excluding
self-loops. Also, suppose that we treat the edges as undirected and divide the
graph into connected components. Then every connected component of size greater than one
that is a cycle increases the answer by one (for example, consider
the cycle  <span class='math'>$\texttt{A}\to \texttt{B}\to \texttt{A}$</span>  in the last test case of
the sample). Note that cycles within larger connected components don&apos;t increase
the answer by one. For example, if the edges in the directed graph are 
<span class='math'>$\texttt{A}\to \texttt{B}, \texttt{B}\to \texttt{A}, \texttt{C}\to \texttt{B}$</span>,
then the answer is three, because we can use the first keystroke to replace
<span class='math'>$\texttt{A}$</span> with <span class='math'>$\texttt{C}$</span>, which breaks the cycle.
<p>Thus, the answer is equal to the following quantity: the number of edges in the
graph excluding self-loops  plus the number of connected components with size
greater than one that are cycles. To prove that this is correct,  it suffices to check that in all cases
where the answer is not <span class='math'>$-1$</span>, any keystroke  will decrease this quantity by at
most one, and that there exists a keystroke that decreases this quantity by one.
