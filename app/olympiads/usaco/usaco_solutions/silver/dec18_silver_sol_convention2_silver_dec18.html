(Analysis by  Nathan Pinsker )
<p>At its core, this is a simulation problem. There are two types of events we must
process:
<p><ul><li> A cow arrives at the pasture </li><li> A cow finishes grazing at the
pasture </li></ul>
<p>Each type of event should also be handled differently depending on whether a cow
is currently grazing, so we actually have a total of four distinct outcomes to
process. Luckily, they each don&apos;t require that much code to implement.
<p>When a cow <span class='math'>$i$</span> arrives at the pasture and it is empty, the cow immediately
starts grazing (its waiting time is 0), and we add a &quot;cow leaving&quot; event <span class='math'>$t_i$</span>
units in the future. However, if the pasture is occupied, then the cow should go
into a &quot;queue&quot; of waiting cows, ordered by seniority. We use a
<a href='href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue&quot;'>priority queue</a> to
keep track of these waiting cows. A priority queue does exactly what we want
here: it enables us to insert keys, and then find the lowest key in the queue
extremely quickly. Therefore, we&apos;ll insert each cow into the priority queue with
a key equal to <span class='math'>$-1$</span> times its seniority. This means we can simply take out the
first element of the priority queue to figure out which cow can graze next. When
we insert a cow into the priority queue, we also keep track of the time it
arrived, so we know how long it spent waiting (which we use to output the final
answer).
<p>When a cow leaves the pasture, if there is no cow in the queue, we just process
the next event. If there is a cow <span class='math'>$i$</span> in the queue, then that cow gets to graze
now, meaning we must add another &quot;cow leaving&quot; event <span class='math'>$t_i$</span> units in the future.
Since we are dynamically adding events and then removing the event with the
lowest timestamp, this means we need another priority queue to keep track of all
the events.
<p>Our overall algorithm is: Add all &quot;cow arriving&quot; events to a priority queue.
Process events until the queue is empty, keeping track of each cow&apos;s waiting
time as described above. Finally, output the maximum over all cow&apos;s waiting
times.
<p>Brian&apos;s solution is below. If you&apos;re a C++ programmer, note Brian&apos;s use of
<span class='math'>$\texttt{pair}$</span> to keep track of waiting cows -- it&apos;s an incredibly useful
structure for programming contests, usually letting you avoid having to create a
structure or a class. If you sort <span class='math'>$\texttt{pair}$</span>s, C++ will order them in
increasing order of their first element, and tiebreak by second element.
<p>(Note from Brian: indeed, although pairs of pairs don&apos;t always make for the
most readable code, so this is one style that you sometimes see in competitive 
programming that you may want to think carefully about using in your 
&quot;real world&quot; programming down the road...)
