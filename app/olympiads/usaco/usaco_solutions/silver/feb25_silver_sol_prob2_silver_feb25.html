(Analysis by Benjamin Qi)
<p>If <span class='math'>$p_j=i$</span>, say that <span class='math'>$j$</span> is a child of <span class='math'>$i$</span> and <span class='math'>$i$</span> is a parent of <span class='math'>$j$</span>. Let&apos;s
first compute the length and number of children for each word <span class='math'>$i$</span>.
<p>When Bessie chooses a word <span class='math'>$w_i$</span> to read from the word bank, what she actually
reads will be some word <span class='math'>$x_i$</span> that is a prefix of <span class='math'>$w_i$</span>. We will initialize
<span class='math'>$x_i=w_i$</span> and then repeatedly replace <span class='math'>$x_i$</span> with its parent while <span class='math'>$w_i$</span> can
still be uniquely identified from <span class='math'>$x_i$</span>. Specifically, 
<p><ol><li>If <span class='math'>$x_i=0$</span> or <span class='math'>$p_{x_i}$</span> has more than one child, we should stop (<span class='math'>$w_i$</span> can&apos;t
be uniquely identified from <span class='math'>$p_{x_i}$</span>).
 </li><li>Otherwise, <span class='math'>$x_i$</span> is the only child of <span class='math'>$p_{x_i}$</span>, so reading <span class='math'>$p_{x_i}$</span> is
enough to uniquely identify <span class='math'>$x_i$</span> and therefore <span class='math'>$w_i$</span>. Thus, we can repeatedly
set <span class='math'>$x_i=p_{x_i}$</span> until the first case holds.</li></ol>
<p>When <span class='math'>$x_i$</span> has been determined, print its length. Then <span class='math'>$w_i$</span> is removed from the
word bank, so all words from <span class='math'>$x_i$</span> to <span class='math'>$w_i$</span> inclusive can be ignored going
forward.  We also decrease the number of children of <span class='math'>$p_{x_i}$</span> by one to account
for ignoring <span class='math'>$x_i$</span>.
<p>The number of operations performed for <span class='math'>$w_i$</span> is proportional to a constant plus
the number of ignored words. As the total number of ignored words cannot exceed
the total number of words, the overall time complexity is <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span>.
<p>Python code:
<p><pre class='prettyprint'>
N = int(input())
P = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
num_child = [0] * (N+1)
length = [0]*(N+1)
for i in range(1,N+1):
    length[i] = length[P[i]]+1
    num_child[P[i]] += 1
 
M = sum(x == 0 for x in num_child)
for _ in range(M):
    x = int(input())
    while True:
        assert num_child[x] == 0
        if x == 0:
            print(0)
            break
        if num_child[P[x]] == 1:
            x = P[x]
            num_child[x] = 0
            continue
        print(length[x])
        num_child[P[x]] -= 1
        break
</pre>
<p>Bonus: The above solution may take proportional to <span class='math'>$N$</span> time to process a single
<span class='math'>$w_i$</span>.  Write a solution that preprocesses the <span class='math'>$p_i$</span> in <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> time, and then 
processes each <span class='math'>$w_i$</span> in <span class='math'>$O(1)$</span> time.
