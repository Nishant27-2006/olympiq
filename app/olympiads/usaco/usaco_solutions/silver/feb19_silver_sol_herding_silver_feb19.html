(Analysis by Brian Dean)
<p>This problem, like its simpler bronze variant, requires a bit of thought
beforehand in terms of characterizing the structure of a solution.
<p>For the minimum, we generally want to look for the length-<span class='math'>$N$</span> window of the
number line containing the most cows (i.e., the fewest empty spaces), since with
care, we can ensure that in any such window, we can fill in the <span class='math'>$x$</span> empty spaces
in the window by exactly <span class='math'>$x$</span> moves.  The only exception, which we handle as a
special case, is a set of <span class='math'>$N-1$</span> consecutive cows, then a gap of size more than 2, 
then another cow -- this case requires 2 moves instead of just 1.  To find
an optimal window, we sort the cows and slide two indices (<span class='math'>$i$</span> and <span class='math'>$j$</span> 
in my code below) representing the
start and end of the window through this ordering, moving the end index in
response to the start index.
<p>For the maximum, the insight is similar to that in the bronze version of this
problem.  Suppose the cows are located at <span class='math'>$A[0] \ldots A[N-1]$</span> in sorted order,
and consider the two endpoint gaps of sizes <span class='math'>$A[1]-A[0]$</span> and <span class='math'>$A[N-1]-A[N-2]$</span>.
Our first move must &quot;sacrifice&quot; one of these gaps --- meaning that we can&apos;t 
move any cows into the gap.  Aside from this one gap, however, we can ensure
that a cow lands on every single empty space in our lineup between <span class='math'>$A[0]$</span>
and <span class='math'>$A[N-1]$</span>.  We can do this by toggling between a state where there are 
two adjacent cows on the left of the ordering and a state where there are 
two adjacent cows on the right side of the ordering.  In my code below, I
could have written the answer as the number of empty spaces mines the smaller
of the two gaps above, but instead I&apos;ve equivalently written it as the number
of spaces left over when the gaps are removed from consideration.
