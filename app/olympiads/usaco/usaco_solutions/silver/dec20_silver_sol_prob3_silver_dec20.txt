(Analysis by Danny Mittal)

We can solve this problem by considering all pairs of a cow going east and a cow
going north in order to determine which cow directly stops which other cow.
Let's say the cow going east starts from

$(x, y)$

and the cow going north starts
from

$(u, v)$

. Their theoretical paths intersect if

$x < u$

and

$v < y$

, in
which case they must intersect at

$(u, y)$

. This means that, assuming both cows
reach

$(u, y)$

(instead of being stopped earlier), the cow that reaches

$(u, y)$

first will stop the other cow (if they both reach at the same time, as per the
problem statement neither one is stopped).

Therefore, in order to determine the stopping relations, you might naively loop
through all pairs of eastward cows and northward cows and see which cows reach
the intersection point first. However, this doesn't account for the fact that
either one may have been stopped earlier.

A clean way to deal with this is to sort all eastward cows by their

$y$

and all
northward cows by their

$x$

, then loop through all pairs of eastward and
northward cows in this order. We then keep track for each cow of whether we know
it is stopped and the amount of cows that we know it has stopped (directly or
indirectly).

The sorting guarantees that each northward cow will be checked against the
eastward cows in increasing order of when the northward cow would reach their
intersection point, and similarly for the eastward cows. Because of this, when
we check a pair of cows neither of which we know has stopped yet, we can be sure
that both will reach the intersection point and thus the earlier one must have
stopped the later one. We also know that this means that the later cow can't now
reach any more intersections than it already has, so the amount of cows it has
stopped is final and we can add it, plus

$1$

for that cow itself, to the count
for the earlier cow.  Note that with other approaches, it may be necessary to
run a second pass of essentially a recursive depth-first search to identify and
count sizes of "connected components" of stopped cows, in order to assign blame
counts appropriately.

The complexity of sorting is

$O(N\log N)$

, and looping through all pairs of
northward and eastward cows is

$O(N^2)$

, so the overall complexity is

$O(N^2)$

.
Solutions in

$O(N^2\log N)$

would also be fast enough.
