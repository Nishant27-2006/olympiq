(Analysis by Spencer Compton)
<p>For Bessie to have an attainable winning tic-tac-toe board configuration, she
must do so  through a sequence of movements and encountering pieces of paper.
Key to this problem is  conceptualizing a &quot;state&quot; that encompasses Bessie&apos;s
situation at any point in time in such a process.
<p>One aspect of Bessie&apos;s state would be what her current tic-tac-toe board looks
like. However, there may be multiple positions in the maze Bessie could be at
with a particular board state (which may affect the potential board states she
could later reach). 
<p>Another aspect of Bessie&apos;s state would be her position in the maze. However,
there could be multiple board states Bessie could have when she is at a
particular position in the maze.
<p>Fortunately, when we combine both of these pieces of information, this perfectly
encapsulates Bessie&apos;s state in the process. Our goal is to first figure out
which states Bessie could possibly reach, and then how many distinct winning
tic-tac-toe board configurations are there such that Bessie can reach a state
with that board configuration.
<p>To find all states Bessie can reach, we can use a depth first search (DFS)
starting at Bessie&apos;s starting position in the maze and an empty tic-tac-toe
board. From each state, we can try recursing a further level by trying to move
in each possible direction in the maze. To make sure our DFS does not take very
long, we will keep track of which states we have visited so we do not need to
revisit them (e.g. we can have a boolean array that indicates whether or not we
have visited each state). Note that if we use a set to keep track of these
states, this might cause a solution to exceed the time limit of some test cases.
Instead, for example, we can convert our board state to a  number and have a
3-dimensional visited array with dimensions for Bessie&apos;s row, column, and board
state (converted to an integer). Since there are <span class='math'>$25^2$</span> possible locations in the
maze and <span class='math'>$\le 3^9$</span> possible board states, our number of states is bounded by <span class='math'>$25^2 \times 3^9$</span>.
<p>Our depth first search will enable us to determine exactly which states Bessie
could obtain, and then we can finally count the number of distinct winning
boards among boards where there is some state such that Bessie could have that
board.
