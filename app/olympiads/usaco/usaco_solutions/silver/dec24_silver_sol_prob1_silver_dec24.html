(Analysis by Agastya Goel, Benjamin Qi, reviewed by Claire Zhang)
<p>Since <span class='math'>$N$</span> is even, Bessie will have <span class='math'>$\frac{N}{2}$</span> turns and Elsie will have
<span class='math'>$\frac{N}{2}-1$</span> turns. First, note that Elsie can always manage to stash any
combination of <span class='math'>$\frac{N}{2}-1$</span> cakes off the ends. If she wants the leftmost <span class='math'>$l$</span>
cakes and the rightmost <span class='math'>$\frac{N}{2}-1-l$</span> cakes, she can get them by spending
the first <span class='math'>$l$</span> turns stashing the current leftmost cake and the next
<span class='math'>$\frac{N}{2}-1-l$</span> turns stashing the current rightmost one.
<p>However, Bessie can stop Elsie from ever stashing more than <span class='math'>$\frac{N}{2}-1$</span> of
the initial cakes by maintaining a single large merged cake which we will call
the *special* cake in the middle of the row. Specifically, Bessie spends her
first turn merging the two centermost cakes, leaving <span class='math'>$\frac{N}{2}-1$</span> unmerged
cakes on either end. For each following turn, if Elsie removes the leftmost
cake, Bessie will merge the special cake with the cake to its right, and if
Elsie removes the rightmost cake, Bessie will merge the special cake with the
cake to its left. Either way, after Elsie has made <span class='math'>$i$</span> moves and Bessie has made
<span class='math'>$i+1$</span>, there will be <span class='math'>$\frac{N}{2}-1-i$</span> cakes on either side of the special cake.
Therefore, Elsie will never be able to stash the special cake.
<p>In summary, Elsie can always get any combination of <span class='math'>$\frac{N}{2}-1$</span> cakes off
the ends and Bessie can prevent her from stashing any more cakes. Thus, if both
players play optimally, Elsie will stash the combination of <span class='math'>$\frac{N}{2}-1$</span>
cakes  off the ends with the largest total size.
<p>Implementation: Bessie will end up with the window of <span class='math'>$N/2+1$</span> consecutive cakes
with the minimum total size. We can first compute
<a href='https://usaco.guide/silver/prefix-sums'>cumulative sums</a> of the input array
and then query for the sum of each window in <span class='math'>$O(1)$</span> time. The overall runtime is
<span class='math'>$O(N)$</span>.
<p>Benjamin Qi&apos;s Python code:
<p><pre class='prettyprint'>
T = int(input())
 
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cum = [0]
    for x in A:
        cum.append(cum[-1] + x)
    min_bessie = float(&apos;inf&apos;)
    for i in range(N - N // 2):
        min_bessie = min(min_bessie, cum[i + N // 2 + 1] - cum[i])
    print(min_bessie, sum(A) - min_bessie)
</pre>
