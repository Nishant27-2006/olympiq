<p>How do we tell if a position can explain spottiness? Let&apos;s turn that question
around and ask the reverse: how do we tell if a position <em>can&apos;t</em> explain
spottiness? The answer to this question is that if we come across two cows, one
of which is spotted and one of which is not, that have the same base in their
genome at that position, then that position isn&apos;t sufficient. This is because we
won&apos;t be able to tell those two cows apart.
<p>The way to solve this problem is to check each set of three positions
individually to see whether they&apos;re sufficient to explain spottiness. For each
of the <span class='math'>$O(M^3)$</span> possible positions, we check whether there&apos;s any matching set of
bases that appears at that position in both a spotty and a non-spotty cow.
<p>If we&apos;re considering a set of positions <span class='math'>$(i, j, k)$</span>, we first iterate over every
non-spotty cow, and recording whether we can find an A, C, G, or T in each  of
the positions <span class='math'>$i$</span>, <span class='math'>$j$</span>, and <span class='math'>$k$</span>. We do the same for the spotty cows, and check
at each step if we&apos;ve already found a non-spotty cow with the same set of three
bases. If we find a spotty cow that shares the same set of three bases with a
non-spotty cow in this position, then these three positions don&apos;t comprise a
valid candidate for explaining spottiness. If we can&apos;t find any of these
overlaps, then this set of three positions can successfully be used.
<p>The most difficult part of this problem might be keeping track of which sets of
three bases we&apos;ve already seen. Luckily, there&apos;s a trick to make it a lot
easier! We can convert &apos;A&apos; to 0, &apos;C&apos; to 1, &apos;G&apos; to 2, and &apos;T&apos; to 3. Then we can
compare two positions <span class='math'>$(i_1, j_1, k_1)$</span> and <span class='math'>$(i_2, j_2, k_2)$</span> by comparing the
values of <span class='math'>$16 \cdot i_1 + 4 \cdot j_1 + k_1$</span> and
<span class='math'>$16 \cdot i_2 + 4 \cdot j_2 + k_2$</span>. The positions will be equal to each other if
and only if these values will be equal -- for the same reason that you can
compare two numbers in base 4 by comparing each of their digits.
<p>The total runtime is <span class='math'>$O(NM^3)$</span>, which is fast enough to receive full credit.
<p>Here&apos;s Brian Dean&apos;s code:
