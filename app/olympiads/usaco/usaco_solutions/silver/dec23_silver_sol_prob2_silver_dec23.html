(Analysis by Andi Qu)
<p>At first glance, this problem may seem like a messy graph problem with the barns
forming some network. Luckily, the way the barns are connected means that we
don&apos;t have to construct a graph explicitly.
<p>The key observation is that because there are <span class='math'>$K$</span> barns in a cycle and <span class='math'>$K$</span> total
pairs of connections, no two barns outside the cycle are connected. (Try drawing
some cycles and counting the connections to verify this fact!) This observation
means that we can split the answer into a sum of two values: the number of
same-labelled barns (a) <em>outside</em> and (b) <em>inside</em> the cycle.
<p>If a barn outside the cycle is labelled the same by Annabelle and Bessie, then
its label must not appear in the lists <span class='math'>$a_i$</span> or <span class='math'>$b_i$</span>. And because the total
number of barns outside the cycle is no greater than the number of integers from
<span class='math'>$1$</span> to <span class='math'>$N$</span> appearing in neither <span class='math'>$a_i$</span> nor <span class='math'>$b_i$</span>, the maximum number of
same-labelled barns outside the cycle is exactly equal to that number. This
value can be computed in <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> time with a set data structure.
<p>To find the maximum number of same-labelled barns inside the cycle, imagine
placing the two cycles on top of each other and rotating one cycle until the
maximum number of labels align. Rotating a cycle and counting the number of
alignments takes <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> time, so a straightforward implementation of this
algorithm would take <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> time. To speed it up, we can count the number of
alignments for a particular rotation (say rotating <span class='math'>$a_i$</span> to the right by <span class='math'>$r$</span>
positions) by counting the number of positions <span class='math'>$i$</span> where <span class='math'>$a_i = b_{i + r}$</span>
(wrapping around as necessary). Specifically:
<p><ul><li>We start with a counter array <span class='math'>$c_0, \dots, c_{K - 1}$</span>, initially all set to
zeroes.</li><li>We iterate over every value in <span class='math'>$a_i$</span> and find the corresponding
value <span class='math'>$b_j = a_i$</span> if it exists.</li><li>We then increment <span class='math'>$c_r$</span> for <span class='math'>$r = i - j$</span>
if <span class='math'>$i \geq j$</span>, or <span class='math'>$r = i - j + K$</span> if <span class='math'>$j &gt; i$</span>.</li><li>Finally, we take the
maximum <span class='math'>$c_r$</span> at the end of this process as the answer.</li></ul>
<p>(Note that we also need to consider the case where the list <span class='math'>$a_i$</span> or <span class='math'>$b_i$</span> is
reversed!)
<p>With this improved algorithm, we no longer iterate over all barns each time we
do a rotation, so it runs in <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> time.
<p>Altogether, this solution runs in <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> time. <span class='math'>$O(N \log N)$</span>-time solutions
using slower set data structures should also pass all test cases.
<p>Python code implementing this solution:
<p><pre class='prettyprint'>
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

same_outside = set(range(1, n + 1)) - set(a) - set(b)

def max_rotation(cycle_a, cycle_b):
    position_a = {val: idx for idx, val in enumerate(cycle_a)}
    with_offset = [0] * k
    for idx, val in enumerate(cycle_b):
        if val in position_a:
            with_offset[idx - position_a[val]] += 1
    return max(with_offset)

print(len(same_outside) +
      max(max_rotation(a, b), max_rotation(a, b[::-1])))
</pre>
