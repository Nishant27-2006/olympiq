Contest Results

(Analysis by Daniel Zhang and Benjamin Qi)

Observe that after performing operations of type 1 and type 2, the grid is in
the following form: there are permutations

$p_1,\ldots,p_N$

and

$q_1,\ldots,q_N$

such that the integer at row

$i$

and column

$j$

equals

$p_i+q_j$

.

Operations of type 3 will relabel the integers in the cells. Our task is now to
find

$p_1,\ldots,p_N$

and

$q_1,\ldots,q_N$

so that

$p_i+q_j$

is the same as the
given table up to relabeling.

Now, if

$p_1,\ldots,p_N$

and

$q_1,\ldots,q_N$

yield a valid answer, then

$N+1-p_1,\ldots,N+1-p_N$

and

$N+1-q_1,\ldots,N+1-q_N$

also yield a valid answer.
This corresponds to replacing each cell with value

$x$

with value

$2N+2-x$

.
Thus, for

$N>1$

, there are always at least two possible answers. The full
solution below will show that there can be no other answers.

Subtask 1

$N\le 6$

We can brute force all permutations

$p_1,\ldots,p_N$

and all permutations

$q_1,\ldots,q_N$

, and check if the result is valid. We then take the
lexicographically minimum valid answer.

This solution takes

$\mathcal{O}(N!^2\cdot N^2)$

.

Daniel Zhang's Python code:

import itertools

N = int(input())

arr = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(N)]

# arr consists of numbers 2,3,...,2N each at least once.
# candidate consists of numbers 2,3,...,2N each at least once.
# This function checks that every instance of integer x in candidate maps to the same value in arr.
# Since arr and candidate have the same number of distinct integers,
# this is enough to ensure that they are relabelings of each other.
def is_valid(candidate):
    label = [None]*(2*N+1)
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if label[candidate[i][j]] is None:
                label[candidate[i][j]] = arr[i][j]
            if label[candidate[i][j]] is not arr[i][j]:
                return False
    return True

best = None
for ps in itertools.permutations(range(1,N+1)):
    for qs in itertools.permutations(range(1,N+1)):
        candidate = [[ps[i]+qs[j] for j in range(N)] for i in range(N)]
        if is_valid(candidate):
            if best is None or candidate < best:
                best = candidate

for line in best:
    print(" ".join(map(str,line)))

Subtask 2

$N\le 8$

We brute force all possible permutations of rows

$p_1,\ldots,p_N$

(type 1
operations).

Suppose we guessed correctly and undid the permutation. The first two rows of
the table would look like

2 3 4 ... N
3 4 5 ... N+1

with columns permuted (type 2 operations), and integers relabeled (type 3
operations)

Now, before type 3 operations, 2 is the only number appearing in the first row
but not the second row, 3 is the number in the second row belonging to the 2 in
the first row, 4 is the number in the second row belonging to the 3 in the first
row, and so on. From this, we can determine

$q_1,\ldots,q_N$

.

Among all our guesses for

$p_1,\ldots,p_N$

and

$q_1,\ldots,q_N$

, we check if it
is valid, and take the lexicographically minimal solution.

This solution takes

$\mathcal{O}(N!\cdot N^2)$

. A more careful analysis of the
below implementation shows it is actually

$O(N!\cdot N)$

.

Subtask 3

$N\le 100$

Observe that row

$i$

and row

$j$

will have

$N-1$

integers in common if and only
if

$|p_i-p_j|=1$

.

The graph on vertices

$1,\ldots,N$

with an edge between

$i$

and

$j$

if row

$i$

and row

$j$

have

$N-1$

integers in common is a path, and the ordering of
vertices on this path determines two possibilities for

$p_1,\ldots,p_N$

(corresponding to traversing the path in two directions).

We can do the same to determine two possibilities for

$q_1,\ldots,q_N$

.

We can check all four candidate answers and take the lexicographical minimum of
the valid ones.

This solution takes

$\mathcal{O}(N^3)$

.

Full solution

For each integer, count the number of times it occurs in the table. Note that
the frequency of the integer in a cell is preserved under relabelings (type 3
operations). We will use this to determine its value before relabelings.

Consider what the table looks like before type 3 operations.

There will be two integers that appear exactly once:

$2$

and

$2N$

. If

$2$

is in
row

$i$

column

$j$

, then

$p_i=1$

and

$q_j=1$

. Then, the numbers in row

$i$

must
be

$1+1,1+2,1+3,\ldots,1+N$

in some order. These have frequencies

$1,2,\ldots,N$

respectively, and the ordering of these in the row uniquely determines

$q_1,\ldots,q_N$

. The numbers in column

$j$

must be

$1+1,2+1,3+1,\ldots,N+1$

in
some order. These have frequencies

$1,2,\ldots,N$

respectively, and the ordering
of these in the column uniquely determines

$p_1,\ldots,p_N$

.

Since frequencies are preserved under type 3 operations, we can still perform
this procedure on the array after type 3 operations to deduce

$p_1,\ldots,p_N$

and

$q_1,\ldots,q_N$

. The only caveat is that we don't know exactly where

$2$

was before type 3 operations, but it must be one of the two cells with a unique
number. These two possibilities yield two potential answers. Furthermore, all
real answers must be included among them. If

$N>1$

, we know there are at least
two answers (the one guaranteed by the problem, and the same after applying

$x\mapsto 2N+2-x$

), meaning that both potential answers are real, and
differ by the map

$x\mapsto 2N+2-x$

.

This solution takes

$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

. This also proves there are at most two
answers, which means that the answer is unique up to the transformation

$x\mapsto 2N+2-x$

.
