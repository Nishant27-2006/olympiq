(Analysis by Brian Dean)
<p>One of the first ingredients in this problem is writing code to test whether two
segments intersect.  This can be done several ways; the preferred method is
probably a standard trick using signs of cross products to test whether segment
<span class='math'>$pq$</span> intersects segment <span class='math'>$rs$</span> by testing if <span class='math'>$p$</span> and <span class='math'>$q$</span> lie on opposite sides of
line <span class='math'>$rs$</span> and <span class='math'>$r$</span> and <span class='math'>$s$</span> lie on opposite sides of line <span class='math'>$pq$</span>.  If you haven&apos;t
seen this approach before, you may want to look up further details and add it to
your  repertoire.
<p>We could solve this problem in <span class='math'>$O(n^2)$</span> time by testing every pair of segments
for intersection, but this would be too slow.  
<p>To start, let&apos;s simplify the problem a little bit, and focus on finding just any
pair of intersecting segments.  Once we have found these, we are essentially
done, since the answer will be one of the two segments --- we just need to count
to see if either of the two segments has multiple intersections (in which case
it is the answer) or else the lower-index segment is the answer.  
<p>To find an intersecting pair of segments, we use what we could call a &quot;plane
sweep&quot; or &quot;sweep line&quot; approach.  Imagine sweeping a vertical line across the
scene from left to right, pausing at every segment endpoint.  We simulate this
by first sorting all the segment endpoints on <span class='math'>$x$</span> and walking through this
sorted array (the array <span class='math'>$P$</span> in my code below).  As we scan, we keep track of all
segments that are currently  &quot;active&quot; in another data structure (called &quot;active&quot;
in my code).  When we hit the leading point of a segment, we add it to the
active set, and when we hit the  trailing point of a segment, we remove it from
the active set.  Since the active set is implemented as an STL set (which is a
balanced binary search tree under the hood), every operation so far takes
<span class='math'>$O(\log n)$</span> time, for a total of <span class='math'>$O(n \log n)$</span> time, including the initial sort.
<p>Our active set of segments will be ordered by <span class='math'>$y$</span> coordinate.  Note that as long
as  we don&apos;t scan across any intersections, the segments will remain
consistently ordered in <span class='math'>$y$</span>, so comparing two segments gives the same answer
during the scan regardless of the <span class='math'>$x$</span> coordinate at which they are evaluated,
and therefore our set data structure doesn&apos;t get confused.  The key insight
now is that if two segments intersect, they must at some point be neighbors
(i.e, adjacent in <span class='math'>$y$</span>) in the active structure.  So whenever we insert a new
segment, we test for intersection between the segments immediately above and
below it (if any) which now become neighbors with the new segment, and  whenever
we delete a segment, we test for intersection between the segments above and
below it, which become neighbors of each-other upon the deletion. The instant we
discover any intersection, we stop sweeping.
<p>My code in C++ is below.  The segment intersection part is a little bit terse,
but this isn&apos;t the &quot;important&quot; part of the solution --- it just tests for
intersection.  The more interesting part of the solution is what follows, where
we sort the segments, scan on <span class='math'>$x$</span>, and test for intersections along the way
while maintaining the active set of segments.  The total running time is 
<span class='math'>$O(n \log n)$</span>.
<p>As a note: we designed the test data for this problem so that other
heuristic-type approaches would hopefully still receive some partial credit.
This problem was definitely towards the higher end of the difficulty scale for a
silver problem, hopefully befitting its placement on the US Open contest.
