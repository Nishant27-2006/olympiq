(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )
<p>Consider any &quot;optimal&quot; sequence of events: a minimum-length sequence of moves or
doublings that causes every farm to have a sick cow. Observe that if an infected
cow at any time moves from some farm <span class='math'>$i$</span> to an adjacent farm <span class='math'>$j$</span> which already
has an infected cow, we can replace this event with a superspreader event at
farm <span class='math'>$j$</span>. This replacement causes an equally optimal sequence of events, because
it doesn&apos;t decrease the ensuing number of infected cows at either farm. So
without loss of generality, we can assume that in the optimal solution, an
infected cow never moves to a farm with another infected cow.
<p>Additionally, suppose that at some point in time, a farm <span class='math'>$i$</span> has exactly one
infected cow, and this cow moves to an adjacent farm <span class='math'>$j$</span>. Then there&apos;ll be no
infected cow in farm <span class='math'>$i$</span>, so at some later time, some infected cow has to move
*into* farm <span class='math'>$i$</span>. Let&apos;s insert into the event sequence a superspreader event at
farm <span class='math'>$i$</span>, right before the infected cow leaves farm <span class='math'>$i$</span>. If we keep the rest of
the sequence the same, farm <span class='math'>$i$</span> will subsequently always have at least one more
cow than in the original sequence. So we can cut out the event where an infected
cow moves back into farm <span class='math'>$i$</span>. This produces an optimal sequence without increasing the number of moves.
So once again, we can assume without loss of generality that the described event
never happens.
<p>This means that if we look at the set of *infected farms*, i.e. farms which have
an infected cow, this set never shrinks, and every time a move event happens,
the set expands by exactly one. Essentially, the set forms an ever-expanding
subtree around farm <span class='math'>$1$</span>.
<p>So our (specifically constructed) optimal sequence of events has exactly <span class='math'>$n-1$</span>
move events, one for each farm besides farm <span class='math'>$1$</span>: the event where this farm
enters the infected set. How many superspreader events do we need?
<p>Root the tree at farm <span class='math'>$1$</span> and consider any subtree rooted at farm <span class='math'>$i$</span>.
Eventually there will be exactly one infected cow in farm <span class='math'>$i$</span> (and none yet in
its subtree). If the farm has <span class='math'>$d(i)$</span> children, then we can do
<span class='math'>$\lceil \log_2 (d(i)+1) \rceil$</span> consecutive superspreader events at farm <span class='math'>$i$</span>,
and then move one infected cow to each child. It&apos;s always better to do all the
superspreader events at farm <span class='math'>$i$</span> before moving cows out to the children, so this
is optimal.
<p>As a result, the total number of superspreader events needed is
<span class='math'>$\sum_i \lceil \log_2 (d(i)+1) \rceil$</span> (summing over all farms with at least one
child) and the minimum number of events needed to infect all farms is this
quantity plus <span class='math'>$n-1$</span>.
