(Analysis by Nick Wu)

In this problem, we have a list of numbers. We want to find a sublist of numbers
where the sum of the numbers is divisible by 7.

Define a prefix of a list to be the first K numbers of the list. Note that any
sublist of numbers can be obtained by taking some prefix of the original list
and removing a smaller prefix of the list. Note furthermore that if you take the
sums of the two prefixes, they have the same remainder when divided by 7.

Therefore, for every prefix, we can compute the sum of the numbers in the prefix
modulo 7, and keep track of the shortest and longest prefixes that when summed
are equivalent to

$x$

modulo 7 for

$0 < x < 7$

. The answer is then the maximum
difference between the lengths of the shortest and longest prefixes over all

$x$

.

Here is my Java code demonstrating this.

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
public class div7 {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("div7.in"));
		PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("div7.out")));
		
		int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
		int[] first = new int[7];
		int[] last = new int[7];
		Arrays.fill(first, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
		first[0] = 0;
		int currPref = 0;
		for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
			currPref += Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
			currPref %= 7;
			first[currPref] = Math.min(first[currPref], i);
			last[currPref] = i;
		}
		int ret = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
			if(first[i] <= n) {
				ret = Math.max(ret, last[i] - first[i]);
			}
		}
		pw.println(ret);
		pw.close();
	}
}
