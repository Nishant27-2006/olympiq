(Analysis by Benjamin Qi)

Sort the intervals from left to right and binary search on the separating
distance

$D$

.  For a fixed

$D$

we want to check whether we can place at least

$N$

cows. This can be done with a greedy strategy; just place each cow at the
leftmost position possible. Once the number of cows placed reaches

$N$

we can
break, so a single

$D$

can be  checked in

$O(N+M)$

time. Thus, the entire
solution runs in

$O((N+M)\log (\text{max dist}))$

time.
