(Analysis by Spencer Compton)
<p>We start by thinking about the structure of Bessie&apos;s journey through time. Since
there are only time portals on years that are multiples of 12, and none of
Bessie&apos;s relatives are born in such a year, to visit some relative Bessie must
also visit the preceding year of the Ox and wait 12 years. For example, if
Bessie has a relative from 15 years ago, Bessie must visit the year of the Ox 24
years ago and must wait until at least the year of the Ox 12 years ago. In other
words, we can think of each year <span class='math'>$x$</span> as belonging to a 12-year cycle
<span class='math'>$\lfloor \frac{x+11}{12} \rfloor$</span>, so <span class='math'>$0$</span> belongs to cycle <span class='math'>$0$</span>, 
<span class='math'>$[1, \dots, 12]$</span> to cycle <span class='math'>$1$</span>, <span class='math'>$[13, \dots, 24]$</span> to cycle <span class='math'>$2$</span>, and so on.
Meaning, if Bessie has a relative in cycle <span class='math'>$x$</span> then Bessie must spend all 12
years in that cycle.
<p>We must use a jump to go back to the earliest cycle, then with the remaining
<span class='math'>$K-1$</span> jumps Bessie can skip over contiguous ranges of unnecessary cycles. It is
then optimal to skip over the <span class='math'>$K-1$</span> largest contiguous ranges of unused cycles.
One way we can accomplish this is by identifying all the cycles Bessie has
relatives in, sorting them, identifying the gaps between adjacent cycles in the
sorted list, and sorting those gaps to find the <span class='math'>$K-1$</span> largest. In total, this
takes  <span class='math'>$O(n \log (n) ) $</span> time.

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(void)
{
  int N, K, years_ago, answer, last = 0;
  cin &gt;&gt; N &gt;&gt; K;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;N; i++) { cin &gt;&gt; years_ago; blocks.insert ((years_ago+11)/12); }
  answer = *blocks.rbegin();
  while (!blocks.empty()) {
    gaps.push_back(*blocks.begin() - last - 1);
    last = *blocks.begin();
    blocks.erase(*blocks.begin());
  }
  sort (gaps.rbegin(), gaps.rend());
  for (int i=0; i&lt;K-1 &amp;&amp; i&lt;gaps.size(); i++) answer -= gaps[i];
  cout &lt;&lt; answer * 12 &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
}
