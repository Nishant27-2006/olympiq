(Analysis by Nick Wu)

In this problem, we have several hay bales on the number line and a few
exploding cows. We can send an exploding cow to a certain location on the line
and it will cause all the hay bales to explode within a given radius. We want to
figure out the smallest radius that the cows can explode at so that we can force
all the hay bales to explode.

Note that if there is some radius

$r$

such that it is possible for all hay bales
to explode, then all the hay bales will explode for any radius

$R > r$

.
Therefore, we can binary search for the minimum radius

$r$

.

To check if a given radius

$r$

is feasible, consider the leftmost hay bale at
location

$x$

. We have to place a cow somewhere between

$x-r$

and

$x+r$

in order
to make that hay bale explode. To make as many other hay bales explode, it makes
sense to move the cow to the right as much as possible, because there are no hay
bales to the left of

$x$

so shifting the cow to the right can only include more
hay bales. Therefore, we would have the hay bale explode at location

$x+r$

and
all hay bales in between

$x$

and

$x+2r$

explode. We can then find the leftmost
hay bale that is at location greater than

$x+2r$

and repeat this process, then
count the number of cows that we placed. If the number of cows used is less than
or equal to

$K$

, then

$r$

is feasible. Otherwise, the answer must be at least

$r+1$

.

Here is my Java code demonstrating this.

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
public class angry {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("angry.in"));
		PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("angry.out")));

		StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
		int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		int k = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		
		int[] locations = new int[n];
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			locations[i] = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
		}
		
		Arrays.sort(locations);
		
		int min = 0;
		int max = 500000000;
		while(min != max) {
			int mid = (min+max)/2;
			int used = 0;
			int last = 0;
			while(last < n) {
				used++;
				int curr = last+1;
				while(curr < n && locations[curr] - locations[last] <= 2*mid) {
					curr++;
				}
				last = curr;
			}
			if(used <= k) {
				max = mid;
			}
			else {
				min = mid+1;
			}
		}
		pw.println(min);
		pw.close();
	}
	
}
