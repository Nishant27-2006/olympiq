(Analysis by Benjamin Qi)
<p><strong>Subtask 1: <span class='math'>$P=1$</span></strong>
<p>Let&apos;s start by computing the following quantity <span class='math'>$Q$</span>: the minimum number of moves
to move all of liquid <span class='math'>$1$</span> to tube <span class='math'>$1$</span> and all of liquid <span class='math'>$2$</span> to tube <span class='math'>$2$</span>. Once we
know how to compute this quantity, we can compute <span class='math'>$Q&apos;$</span>, the minimum number of
moves to move all of liquid <span class='math'>$1$</span> to tube <span class='math'>$2$</span> and all of liquid <span class='math'>$2$</span> to tube <span class='math'>$1$</span>,
in a similar way. The answer for this subtask will then be <span class='math'>$\min(Q,Q&apos;)$</span>.
<p>The current state of liquid in the tubes and beakers can be represented by three
binary strings <span class='math'>$f$</span>, <span class='math'>$s$</span>, and <span class='math'>$b$</span>, with <span class='math'>$f$</span> and <span class='math'>$s$</span> defined the same way as the
problem statement, and <span class='math'>$b$</span> denoting the state of the beaker from bottom to top.
<p>First, observe that <span class='math'>$Q$</span> does not change if we make the following
simplifications:
<p><ol><li>Compress runs of equal characters in all three strings. For example, 1221
becomes 121 and 2211 becomes 21.</li><li>Remove the first character of <span class='math'>$f$</span> if it is <span class='math'>$1$</span>, since this liquid never
needs to leave tube <span class='math'>$1$</span></li><li>Similarly, remove the first character of <span class='math'>$s$</span> if it is <span class='math'>$2$</span>.</li></ol>
<p>Next, observe that <span class='math'>$Q$</span> must be at least the number of characters after
simplifying, because after performing any move and simplifying again, the number
of characters will have stayed the same or gone down by one. The final state
corresponds to all of <span class='math'>$f$</span>, <span class='math'>$s$</span>, and <span class='math'>$b$</span> simplifying to empty strings.
<p>Is <span class='math'>$Q$</span> exactly equal to the number of characters after simplifying? It is when
we don&apos;t need to utilize the beaker. For example, consider the following input:
<p><pre>
f = &quot;111112&quot;
s = &quot;222222&quot;
</pre>
<p>After simplifying,
<p><pre>
f = &quot;2&quot;
s = &quot;&quot;
</pre>
<p>So the number of characters after simplifying is one, and <span class='math'>$Q=1$</span> because we only
need one pour to separate the liquid (tube 1 into tube 2). However, when the
number of characters after simplifying is greater than one, we need to utilize
the beaker, and when we first pour liquid into the beaker the number of
characters after simplifying does not change. In such cases, <span class='math'>$Q$</span> is at least the
number of characters after simplifying plus one. For example, the first test
case of the sample input after simplifying becomes:
<p><pre>
f = &quot;21&quot;
s = &quot;1&quot;
</pre>
<p>There are three characters after simplifying, and <span class='math'>$Q=4$</span>.
<p>Is it true that <span class='math'>$Q$</span> is always at most the number of characters after simplifying
plus one? Assuming this allows you to solve the first subtask.   At this point,
it&apos;s not obvious why this assumption is correct, but we will prove that it works
later by providing a construction using exactly this number of moves.
<p>Implementation (which computes <span class='math'>$\min(Q,Q&apos;)$</span> directly rather than <span class='math'>$Q$</span> and <span class='math'>$Q&apos;$</span> separately):

<p><strong>Subtask 2: <span class='math'>$P=2$</span></strong>
<p>Here we provide a construction that moves all of liquid <span class='math'>$i$</span> into tube <span class='math'>$i$</span> and 
achieves a number of moves at most the number of characters after compressing
runs plus two. From the previous subtask, we know that the answer must be at
least the number of characters after compressing runs minus two. Therefore, our
solution is at most four away from optimal.
<p><ol><li>While tube <span class='math'>$2$</span> is nonempty, pour it into tube <span class='math'>$1$</span> if tube <span class='math'>$2$</span> has liquid <span class='math'>$2$</span>
on top, or to the beaker otherwise.</li><li>While tube <span class='math'>$1$</span> is nonempty, pour it into tube <span class='math'>$2$</span> if tube <span class='math'>$1$</span> has liquid <span class='math'>$2$</span>

liquid <span class='math'>$1$</span>. The final step is to pour from the beaker into tube
<span class='math'>$1$</span>.</li></ol>

<p><strong>Subtask 3: <span class='math'>$P=3$</span></strong>
<p>Our construction achieving the optimal number of moves is similar to the one for
the previous subtask in the sense that we first empty out most of one tube, then
most of the other, and finally the beaker.
<p>Before describing the strategy we use the following trick to ensure that we
never need to deal with a tube being empty, which makes the implementation
simpler. Suppose we choose to move all of liquid <span class='math'>$1$</span> to tube <span class='math'>$1$</span> and liquid <span class='math'>$2$</span> 
to tube <span class='math'>$2$</span>; then let&apos;s insert an extra <span class='math'>$1$</span> in front of <span class='math'>$f$</span> and an extra <span class='math'>$2$</span> in
front of <span class='math'>$s$</span> before compressing runs (or the other way around if we choose to
move liquid <span class='math'>$1$</span> to tube <span class='math'>$2$</span> and liquid <span class='math'>$2$</span> to tube <span class='math'>$1$</span>).
<p>Our strategy is as follows. We assume that before every move we perform step <span class='math'>$1$</span>
only of the simplification process described in subtask 1 (compressing runs of
equal characters).
<p><ol><li>If the last characters of <span class='math'>$f$</span> and <span class='math'>$s$</span> are equal, choose any tube with a
string of length greater than one and pour it into the other tube.</li><li>If both <span class='math'>$f$</span> and <span class='math'>$s$</span> now have length one, we&apos;re done. Otherwise, we&apos;re in a
case where the beaker must be used. Choose any tube with a string of length
greater than one and pour it into the beaker. The last characters of both tube
strings are now equal.</li><li>Suppose the beaker now contains liquid <span class='math'>$i$</span>. Choose the tube whose string has
first character <em>not</em> equal to <span class='math'>$i$</span>, and repeatedly pour from it until its
string has length equal to one. We should pour it into either the beaker or the
other tube depending on which pour reduces the number of characters after
compressing by one.</li><li>Next, pour from the other tube until its string has length one.</li><li>Finally, pour from the beaker into one of the tubes.</li></ol>
<p>Example:
<p><pre>
Initial:
f = 12121
s = 2121

After step 1:
f = 1212
s = 2121

After step 2:
f = 1212
s = 212
b = 1

After step 3:
f = 1212
s = 2
b = 1

After step 4:
f = 1
s = 2
b = 1

After step 5:
f = 1
s = 2
</pre>
<p>Every move besides the first move into the beaker reduces the number of
characters after compressing by one, so this construction matches the lower
bound we described in subtask 1.
