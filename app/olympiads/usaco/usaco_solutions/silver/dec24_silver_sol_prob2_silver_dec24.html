(Analysis by Tina Wang, reviewed by Benjamin Qi)
<p><strong>Subtask 1: <span class='math'>$N, K \leq 16$</span></strong>
<p>We can simulate the removal of all combinations of trees and check if it
satisfies all constraints in <span class='math'>$O(2^N\cdot K)$</span> time.
<p><strong>Subtask 3: <span class='math'>$t_i = 1$</span> for all <span class='math'>$i = 1, \dots, N$</span></strong>
<p>We solve the problem by considering the reverse case: start with all trees
removed and selectively choose trees to grow until all constraints are
satisfied. A constraint interval is considered processed if the number of trees
in it is at least <span class='math'>$t_i$</span>.
<p>We sort the intervals by their right endpoint and process them in this order.
<p><ol><li>If an interval already has enough trees (<span class='math'>$\geq t_i$</span>), we skip it. </li><li>Otherwise, we add the rightmost tree in the interval.</li></ol>
<p>Adding the rightmost tree is correct because any unprocessed intervals that
overlap with the current interval must extend beyond its right endpoint. By
adding the rightmost tree, we ensure it helps satisfy all such intervals, as any
shared trees are guaranteed to include this rightmost one.
<p>Therefore, we add the rightmost tree for each interval if it has not been
satisfied already. This takes <span class='math'>$O((N+K)\log(N+K))$</span> time.

<pre class='prettyprint'>
import bisect
 
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    x = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    restr = []
    for i in range(k):
        l, r, t = map(int, input().split())
        restr.append((r, l, t))
    restr.sort()
    trees = []
    for (r, l, t) in restr:
        if len(trees) == 0 or trees[-1] &lt; l:
            trees.append(x[bisect.bisect_right(x, r) - 1])
    print(n - len(trees))
</pre>
<p><strong>Subtask 2: <span class='math'>$N, K \leq 1000$</span></strong>
<p>We note that even when <span class='math'>$t_i \geq 1$</span>, the observation still holds; choosing the
<span class='math'>$t_i$</span> rightmost trees to keep in an interval maximizes the number of potential
intervals satisfied. 
<p>Therefore, we can loop through a sorted list of the constraints and greedily add
trees from right to left until the constraint is satisfied. This can be done in
<span class='math'>$O(NK)$</span> time.

    restr.sort()
    planted = [False for i in x]
    for (r, l, t) in restr:
        cnt = 0
        for i in range(len(x)):
            if x[i] &gt;= l and x[i] &lt;= r and planted[i]:

            if cnt &lt; t and x[i] &gt;= l and x[i] &lt;= r and not planted[i]:
                planted[i] = True
                cnt = cnt + 1

<p><strong>Full Solution</strong>
<p>To pass all test cases, we consider processing both trees and intervals at the
same time, in sorted order of tree coordinate and the restriction&apos;s left
coordinate. Each time we encounter a tree, we consider all intervals which
currently contain it; if the tree can be cut (i.e., if the number of cut trees
in the interval is less than the total number of trees minus <span class='math'>$t_i$</span>), we cut the
tree and increment the answer. Otherwise, we continue. 
<p>However, the above solution runs in <span class='math'>$O(NK)$</span> time as for each tree <span class='math'>$O(K)$</span>
intervals are checked.
<p>To speed up this solution, we consider a case where we encounter a new interval
while checking both trees and intervals. Clearly, the current number of trees
cut down is the best answer for the entire range to the left endpoint of the
interval. The new constraint tells us that there can be at most
<span class='math'>$cut = existing - t_i$</span> number of trees cut down in the interval, as otherwise
the constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, before passing the right endpoint of
this new interval, no more than <span class='math'>$ans + cut$</span> trees can be cut down. To
efficiently manage this, we use a priority queue to keep track of the most
restrictive constraints for the trees. The priority queue is sorted so that the
smallest allowed number of trees to cut is always at the top; when considering
each tree, we simply check if the maximum number of trees allowed has been cut
already. If not, we greedily cut the current tree as well.
<p>This speeds the solution up to <span class='math'>$O((N+K)\log(N+K))$</span>, which is sufficient to pass.

import bisect
import heapq
 
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    x = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    events = [(i, 0, 0, 0) for i in x]
    for i in range(k):
        l, r, t = map(int, input().split())
        existing = bisect.bisect_right(x, r) - bisect.bisect_left(x, l)
        events.append((l, -1, r, existing - t))
    events.sort()
    pq = []
    ans = 0
    for l, tp, r, cut in events:
        if tp == -1:
            heapq.heappush(pq, (ans + cut, r))
        else:
            while len(pq) != 0 and pq[0][1] &lt; l:
                heapq.heappop(pq)
            if len(pq) == 0 or pq[0][0] != ans:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)

<p><strong>Alternative Full Solution (requires a Gold-level data structure):</strong>
<p>We take the solution to subtask 2 and speed it up. The part of the solution
which is hardest to optimize is the calculation of the number of planted trees
in the current interval, which takes <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> time naively:
<p><pre class='prettyprint'>
cnt = 0
for i in range(len(x)):
    if x[i] &gt;= l and x[i] &lt;= r and planted[i]:
        cnt = cnt + 1
</pre>
<p>If we insert all planted trees into an
<a href='https://usaco.guide/gold/PURS?lang=cpp#order-statistic-tree'>order statistics
tree</a>, then,  querying the number of planted trees in an interval takes
<span class='math'>$O(\log N)$</span> time. The overall time complexity is reduced to <span class='math'>$O((N+K)\log(N+K))$</span>.
