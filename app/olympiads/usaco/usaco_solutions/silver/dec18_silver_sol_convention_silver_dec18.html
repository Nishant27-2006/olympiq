(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )
<p>Note that the corresponding &quot;decision problem&quot;--determine whether <span class='math'>$M$</span> buses
suffice if every cow waits at most <span class='math'>$T$</span> minutes--can be solved efficiently by a
greedy algorithm. Additionally, the decision problem is monotonic in <span class='math'>$T$</span>: that
is, if a maximum waiting time of <span class='math'>$T$</span> is impossible, then no smaller maximum
waiting time will be possible. 
<p>This means that we can find the smallest possible
maximum waiting time by binary searching for the answer. We start off knowing
that the answer is in some range <span class='math'>$[l,r]$</span>. Then we check whether <span class='math'>$M$</span> buses
suffice if every cow waits at most <span class='math'>$T = (l+r)/2$</span> minutes. If yes, we can narrow
the range to <span class='math'>$[l, (l+r)/2]$</span>; if no, we can narrow the range to <span class='math'>$((l+r)/2, r]$</span>.
Then we recurse. In our case, we have an initial range <span class='math'>$[0, 10^9]$</span> (since the
optimal waiting time must be nonnegative, but we can clearly get away with only
one bus if every cow waits <span class='math'>$10^9$</span> timesteps), so the binary search will
terminate in about <span class='math'>$\log_2 10^9 \approx 30$</span> iterations.
<p>Now, we must solve the decision problem. As mentioned, it lends itself to a
greedy algorithm. Fix some desired maximum waiting time <span class='math'>$T$</span>. Suppose that we
want to find the minimum number of buses needed so that every cow waits at most
<span class='math'>$T$</span> timesteps. Then the first bus cannot leave more than <span class='math'>$T$</span> timesteps after the
first cow arrives. But there&apos;s also no point to leaving earlier! If at most <span class='math'>$C$</span>
cows have arrived by this point (<span class='math'>$T$</span> timesteps after the arrival of the first
cow), then the first bus simply takes these cows. Otherwise, the bus ought to
take the first <span class='math'>$C$</span> cows who arrive (since these cows &quot;expire&quot; soonest).
<p>So the first bus takes some prefix of the cows: either the first <span class='math'>$C$</span> cows, or
all cows who arrive at most <span class='math'>$T$</span> timesteps after the first cow. After this bus
has left, the same argument applies to the second bus and the remaining cows. So
for each bus, we can figure out the optimal set of cows it can take. If after
<span class='math'>$M$</span> buses, not all cows have left, then <span class='math'>$T$</span> is not a feasible maximum waiting
time. Otherwise, it is.
