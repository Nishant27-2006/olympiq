(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )
<p>Suppose that early in the hike there is a rest stop with tastiness <span class='math'>$c$</span>, but
later there is a rest stop with tastiness <span class='math'>$C$</span>, where <span class='math'>$C &gt; c$</span>. Then it is never
optimal for Bessie to spend any time at the first rest stop: if she did, she
could spend the same amount of time at the later rest stop instead, and she
would still never be behind Farmer John. So the only rest stops which Bessie
might stop at are the rest stops which have more tastiness than any subsequent
rest stops.
<p>We can find these &quot;right-maximal&quot; rest stops in a single right-to-left scan,
keeping track of the largest tastiness seen so far. Now we can simply perform a
greedy algorithm: never stop at non-right-maximal rest stops. At a right-maximal
rest stop, Bessie should stop there as long as possible (i.e. until Farmer John
catches up with her). Then she proceeds, until the next right-maximal rest stop.
<p>To see correctness of this greedy algorithm, suppose Bessie did not spend as
long as possible at some right-maximal rest stop <span class='math'>$r$</span>. Then she would leave this
rest stop <span class='math'>$t$</span> seconds early, for some positive <span class='math'>$t$</span>. Suppose the next place
Bessie stops is rest stop <span class='math'>$r&apos;$</span>. We could improve Bessie&apos;s tastiness intake by
having her spend <span class='math'>$1$</span> less second at <span class='math'>$r&apos;$</span>, and <span class='math'>$1$</span> more second at rest stop <span class='math'>$r$</span>.
It can be verified that Bessie will still never be behind Farmer John, and since
the tastiness at <span class='math'>$r$</span> is greater than the tastiness at <span class='math'>$r&apos;$</span>, we improved Bessie&apos;s
outcome. Therefore no optimal solution will leave a right-maximal rest stop
early, and our greedy algorithm is correct. 
<p>The above algorithm can be implemented with only two scans of the input, first right-to-left and then left-to-right. So the overall time complexity is <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span>.
