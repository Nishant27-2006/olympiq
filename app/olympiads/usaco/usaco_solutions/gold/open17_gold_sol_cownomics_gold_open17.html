<p>The first approach to this problem is to simply brute-force: first, compute all
substring sequences of length 1 for both spotty and non-spotty cows. Put these
sequences into two different sets, and make sure that the sets are completely
disjoint -- if they are, then sequences of length 1 are sufficient to tell these
types of cows apart, and we are finished. Otherwise, we consider all substring
sequences of length 2, and continue to consider longer and longer substrings
until our subsets are completely disjoint.
<p>The problem with this approach is that string comparison will eventually become
too slow. Since there may be as many <span class='math'>$O(NM^2)$</span> strings in total and <span class='math'>$M &lt;= 500$</span>,
and comparing all of these strings will take too much time and memory. One way
around this problem is to use a
<a href='href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_hash&quot;'>rolling hash function</a>.
The main benefit of a rolling hash is that you can hash a string in <span class='math'>$O(n)$</span> time,
and then find in <span class='math'>$O(1)$</span> time the hash of any substring of that string. (If you
don&apos;t know what a rolling hash function is, learning about it is really worth
your time -- it pops up all the time in programming contests!) Thus, instead of
comparing and storing all substring sequences, we can simply store the hashes of
all substring sequences instead. To compare two substring sequences, we instead
compare their hashes. While this does have a small probability of error, the
hashes are large enough (and <span class='math'>$M$</span> is small enough) that this shouldn&apos;t be an
issue in practice. 
<p>Contestants can also use a binary search to quickly locate the minimum value --
if all substrings with length <span class='math'>$k$</span> are unique to either spotted or non-spotted
cows, then all substrings with length <span class='math'>$k+1$</span> are unique to either spotted or
non-spotted cows as well. Using either this approach or the hashing approach is
sufficient to receive full credit.
<p>Here&apos;s Brian Dean&apos;s code, which uses the hashing approach with a very simple
hash function -- it hashes a substring by simply taking a dot product between that
string and a random vector of integers.
