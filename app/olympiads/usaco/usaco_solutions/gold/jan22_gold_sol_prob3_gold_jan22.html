(Analysis by Danny Mittal)
<p>Consider creating a tree on the indexes of the array as follows. For an index
<span class='math'>$i$</span>, let its parent be <span class='math'>$j_i + 1$</span>. Note that this means that we&apos;ll also need a
node <span class='math'>$N + 1$</span>, since <span class='math'>$j_N + 1 = N + 1$</span>; this node will be the root of the tree.
<p>Let&apos;s define the height of a node as the depth of the deepest node minus its own
depth. This tree construction is illustrated below for the sample with heights
on the left.

<p>Notice that as we go down the array from index <span class='math'>$N$</span> to index <span class='math'>$1$</span>, the heights of
the corresponding nodes decrease. This means that the array consists of first
the nodes at height <span class='math'>$0$</span>, then the nodes at height <span class='math'>$1$</span>, etc. Additionally, since
each node <span class='math'>$i$</span>&apos;s parent is <span class='math'>$j_i + 1$</span>, which is the first index whose element
<span class='math'>$a_{j_i + 1}$</span> is greater than <span class='math'>$a_i + K$</span>, and a node&apos;s parent necessarily has
height <span class='math'>$1$</span> higher than the height of that node, the nodes at a certain height
need to have values that are approximately <span class='math'>$K$</span> higher than the values of the
nodes at the immediately lower height.
<p>This suggests that we assign the values of the nodes as <span class='math'>$a_i = h_i K + x_i$</span>,
where <span class='math'>$h_i$</span> is the height of node <span class='math'>$i$</span> and <span class='math'>$x_i$</span> is some yet to be determined
value between <span class='math'>$0$</span> and <span class='math'>$K - 1$</span>. Using these values means that
<span class='math'>$a_i + K = (h_i + 1)K + x_i$</span>, which means that the point at which values go from
being less than <span class='math'>$a_i + K$</span> to more than <span class='math'>$a_i + K$</span> occurs at height <span class='math'>$h_i + 1$</span>,
which is exactly what we want since <span class='math'>$i$</span>&apos;s parent, <span class='math'>$j_i + 1$</span>, is at height
<span class='math'>$h_i + 1$</span>.
<p>All that remains is to choose values of <span class='math'>$x_i$</span> appropriately so that that point
occurs at exactly the right place inside height <span class='math'>$h_i + 1$</span>. This means choosing
the <span class='math'>$x$</span> values so that <span class='math'>$x_{j_i + 1} &gt; x_i$</span>, but any smaller indexes at height
<span class='math'>$h_i + 1$</span> have an <span class='math'>$x$</span> value less than or equal to <span class='math'>$x_i$</span>.
<p>We can do this using DFS. We start by assigning the root node <span class='math'>$N + 1$</span> to have
<span class='math'>$x_{N + 1} = K - 1$</span>, the largest <span class='math'>$x$</span> value possible. Then, it DFSs through its
children starting from the largest index and going down. Whenever we reach a
node, we assign it the next lower <span class='math'>$x$</span> value, then DFS through its children in
decreasing order. This guarantees that every node <span class='math'>$i$</span> has an <span class='math'>$x$</span> value larger
than <span class='math'>$i$</span>&apos;s children, but all smaller indexes at the same height as <span class='math'>$i$</span> get an
<span class='math'>$x$</span> value smaller than <span class='math'>$i$</span>&apos;s children, since the DFS reaches them only after
searching through all of <span class='math'>$i$</span>&apos;s descendants. 
<p>Since each node will get a unique <span class='math'>$x$</span> value, we need to set <span class='math'>$K = N + 1$</span> in order
to ensure that all <span class='math'>$x$</span> values are between <span class='math'>$0$</span> and <span class='math'>$K - 1$</span>. The <span class='math'>$x$</span> values for
the sample are illustrated below.

<p>As an example of how this construction works, consider index <span class='math'>$4$</span>, which has
<span class='math'>$j_4 = 5$</span>. Its height is <span class='math'>$1$</span> and its <span class='math'>$x$</span> value is <span class='math'>$x_4 = 4$</span>, which means that
its array value will be <span class='math'>$a_4 = (1)K + 4 = (1)(7) + 4$</span>, and <span class='math'>$a_4 + K$</span> will be
<span class='math'>$(2)(7) + 4$</span>.
<p>Index <span class='math'>$5$</span> is at height <span class='math'>$2$</span> but has the smaller <span class='math'>$x$</span> value <span class='math'>$x_5 = 3$</span>, so its array
value will be <span class='math'>$a_5 = (2)(7) + 3$</span>, which is smaller than <span class='math'>$a_4 + K = (2)(7) + 4$</span>.
Similarly, index <span class='math'>$6$</span> is at height <span class='math'>$2$</span> and has the larger <span class='math'>$x$</span> value <span class='math'>$x_6 = 5$</span>, so
its array value will be <span class='math'>$a_6 = (2)(7) + 5$</span>, which is larger than
<span class='math'>$a_4 + K = (2)(7) + 4$</span>. Therefore index <span class='math'>$5$</span> is the largest index <span class='math'>$j$</span> satisfying
<span class='math'>$a_j \leq a_4 + K$</span>, and so the requirement <span class='math'>$j_4 = 5$</span> is satisfied.
<p>Using these <span class='math'>$x$</span> values, we can calculate our array <span class='math'>$a$</span> along with the choice of
<span class='math'>$K = N + 1$</span> to produce a valid construction. Our algorithm simply consists of
constructing the tree then performing a DFS to compute the <span class='math'>$x$</span> values as well as
the heights. This runs in <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> time.
<p>The array values for all indexes in the sample are illustrated below.
