(Analysis by Nick Wu)

We start by presenting an

$O(N^2)$

brute force algorithm - for a given cow, we
can scan over all the other cows and count the number of cows taller than the
given cow on both sides and then determine if the cow is unbalanced.

One possible improvement we could do is sort the cows in decreasing order of
height. If we process the cows in that order, then we can maintain the indices
of all the taller cows. This only improves the performance of the algorithm by a
constant factor. However, we will use this change in algorithm to present an

$O(N \log N)$

solution.

When we maintain the indices of all the taller cows, we would like to be able to
efficiently query for how many indices are less than a given index, and to also
be able to insert an index into this collection. More precisely, our data
structure needs to efficiently support the following operations:

$Insert(x)$

: Insert

$x$

into the data structure.

$LessThan(x)$

: Count how many numbers in the data structure are less than

$x$

.

We will use a data structure known as a Fenwick tree, or a binary indexed tree,
to support these two operations. A Fenwick tree operates on an internal array of
integers

$a_1, \dots, a_N$

and supports two operations in

$O(\log N)$

:

$Update(x, v)$

: Increase

$a_x$

by

$v$

.

$Query(x)$

: Return

$\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^x a_i$

.

Our approach is as follows: Imagine that we have sorted the cows in decreasing
height, and initialize a sequence

$a_1$

through

$a_N$

to be zero everywhere.
Imagine that we are considering the

$k$

th tallest cow which is at index

$i$

. We
compute

$L_k = Query(i)$

and

$R_k = k-1-L_k$

. If

$\displaystyle\frac{\max(L_k, R_k)}{\min(L_k, R_k)} > 2$

, then we assert that
cow

$k$

is unbalanced. Finally, we set

$a_i = 1$

by calling

$Update(i, 1)$

.

In this approach, we maintain the invariant that

$a_i = 1$

if and only if every
cow being considered from the moment

$a_i$

is set to 1 is shorter than the cow
at index

$i$

. The Fenwick tree lets us efficiently query for the number of cows
to the left of the given cow that are taller than it.
