(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>We start by presenting an <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> brute force algorithm - for a given cow, we
can scan over all the other cows and count the number of cows taller than the
given cow on both sides and then determine if the cow is unbalanced.
<p>One possible improvement we could do is sort the cows in decreasing order of
height. If we process the cows in that order, then we can maintain the indices
of all the taller cows. This only improves the performance of the algorithm by a
constant factor. However, we will use this change in algorithm to present an
<span class='math'>$O(N \log N)$</span> solution.
<p>When we maintain the indices of all the taller cows, we would like to be able to
efficiently query for how many indices are less than a given index, and to also
be able to insert an index into this collection. More precisely, our data
structure needs to efficiently support the following operations:
<p><span class='math'>$Insert(x)$</span>: Insert <span class='math'>$x$</span> into the data structure.
<p><span class='math'>$LessThan(x)$</span>: Count how many numbers in the data structure are less than <span class='math'>$x$</span>.
<p>We will use a data structure known as a Fenwick tree, or a binary indexed tree,
to support these two operations. A Fenwick tree operates on an internal array of
integers <span class='math'>$a_1, \dots, a_N$</span> and supports two operations in <span class='math'>$O(\log N)$</span>:
<p><span class='math'>$Update(x, v)$</span>: Increase <span class='math'>$a_x$</span> by <span class='math'>$v$</span>.
<p><span class='math'>$Query(x)$</span>: Return <span class='math'>$\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^x a_i$</span>.
<p>Our approach is as follows: Imagine that we have sorted the cows in decreasing
height, and initialize a sequence <span class='math'>$a_1$</span> through <span class='math'>$a_N$</span> to be zero everywhere.
Imagine that we are considering the <span class='math'>$k$</span>th tallest cow which is at index <span class='math'>$i$</span>. We
compute <span class='math'>$L_k = Query(i)$</span> and <span class='math'>$R_k = k-1-L_k$</span>. If
<span class='math'>$\displaystyle\frac{\max(L_k, R_k)}{\min(L_k, R_k)} &gt; 2$</span>, then we assert that
cow <span class='math'>$k$</span> is unbalanced. Finally, we set <span class='math'>$a_i = 1$</span> by calling <span class='math'>$Update(i, 1)$</span>.
<p>In this approach, we maintain the invariant that <span class='math'>$a_i = 1$</span> if and only if every
cow being considered from the moment <span class='math'>$a_i$</span> is set to 1 is shorter than the cow
at index <span class='math'>$i$</span>. The Fenwick tree lets us efficiently query for the number of cows
to the left of the given cow that are taller than it.
