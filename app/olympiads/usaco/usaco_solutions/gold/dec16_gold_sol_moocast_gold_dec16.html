(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>In this problem, we have <span class='math'>$N$</span> cows scattered on the plane and want to compute the
minimum distance <span class='math'>$D$</span> such that all cows are able to communicate with each other
(perhaps through some intermediate cows), given that two cows can only
communicate directly if the distance between them is less than or equal to
<span class='math'>$D$</span>.
<p>We can model this problem as a graph problem where each cow is a vertex
connected to every other cow with an edge with the weight being the distance
between the two cows. We therefore want to compute the minimum edge weight such
that the graph is connected.
<p>We can solve this problem using a union-find data structure. A simple 
union-find data structure supports two operations:
<p><span class='math'>$Find(x)$</span> - return a unique identifier for vertex <span class='math'>$x$</span>. <span class='math'>$Find(x) = Find(y)$</span> if
and only if <span class='math'>$x$</span> and <span class='math'>$y$</span> are in the same connected component.
<p><span class='math'>$Merge(x, y)$</span> - connect <span class='math'>$x$</span> and <span class='math'>$y$</span> with an edge.
<p>Let&apos;s assume that we have a sufficiently efficient implementation of a
union-find data structure. Given the original <span class='math'>$N$</span> vertices are all pairwise
disconnected, we can loop over the edges in nondecreasing order by weight and
add an edge between two vertices if they are not already in the same component.
After we add <span class='math'>$N-1$</span> edges, the graph is necessarily connected, and the last edge
gives us our answer.
<p>It remains to implement the union-find data structure efficiently. We will
describe an implementation that supports both operations in essentially <span class='math'>$O(1)$</span>.
<p>We start by describing an approach that supports both operations in linear time,
which will not be fast enough for our purposes.
<p>We start by annotating each node with a &quot;parent&quot; field - each node starts out
with itself being the parent. When we call <span class='math'>$Find(x)$</span>, either <span class='math'>$x$</span> is its own
parent, in which case we return <span class='math'>$x$</span>, or we return <span class='math'>$Find(parent(x))$</span>. When we
call <span class='math'>$Merge(x, y)$</span>, we set the parent of <span class='math'>$Find(x)$</span> to <span class='math'>$Find(y)$</span>. 
<p>Intuitively, what we are doing here is building a rooted tree and when we want
to merge two trees, we have the root of one tree point to the root of the other
tree.
<p>The reason that this runs in linear time is that the depth of the tree may be
linear. There are a couple ways to improve the performance here - if we always
are careful to set the parent of the root of the smaller tree to the root of the
larger tree, then the depth of the tree is bounded to <span class='math'>$O(\log N)$</span>. Another
approach we can take is path compression - when we compute <span class='math'>$Find(parent(x))$</span>, we
can memoize that value.
<p>My Java solution uses the latter approach.
