(Analysis by Andi Qu)
<p>For each sub-case, we need to check 4 conditions:
<p><strong>Condition 1:</strong> Every color appears in a contiguous range of <span class='math'>$x$</span>&apos;s.
<p>We can check this condition by maintaining an array that describes at which <span class='math'>$x$</span>
a color last appeared. If the last <span class='math'>$x$</span> is always 1 less than the current <span class='math'>$x$</span>,
then this condition holds.
<p>Sub-case 2 in the example does not satisfy this condition.
<p><strong>Condition 2:</strong> For each <span class='math'>$x$</span>, if one appearance of color <span class='math'>$a$</span> is after the
first appearance and before the second appearance of color <span class='math'>$b$</span>, then the other
appearance of color <span class='math'>$a$</span> must do the same.
<p>Let&apos;s say that a color becomes &quot;activated&quot; when it appears for the first time,
and then &quot;deactivated&quot; when it appears the second time. We can then check this
condition by maintaining a stack of active colors. When a color becomes
deactivated, it must be at the top of the stack. If this is always true, then
this condition holds.
<p>Sub-case 3 in the example does not satisfy this condition.
<p>If the 2 appearances of color <span class='math'>$a$</span> are between the 2 appearances of color <span class='math'>$b$</span>,
then we know that bracelet <span class='math'>$a$</span> must be contained inside bracelet <span class='math'>$b$</span>. This
hierarchical relationship allows us to transform the bracelets into a tree
structure, where:
<ul><li>The nodes are the bracelets.</li><li>If a bracelet is contained by another
bracelet, then its parent is the innermost bracelet that contains it.</li><li>Otherwise, its parent is a placeholder node (e.g. node <span class='math'>$0$</span>).</li></ul>
<p><strong>Condition 3:</strong> Each node&apos;s parent in the tree must be consistent for every
<span class='math'>$x$</span> it appears in.
<p>This is because if some color appears, then its parent must also appear. We can
check this condition by maintaining an array describing the parents of colors
we&apos;ve seen before. We can then check this array against the input for each <span class='math'>$x$</span>.
<p><strong>Condition 4:</strong> The ordering of colors in the input must be consistent for
every <span class='math'>$x$</span> it appears in.
<p>We can check this condition by maintaining 2 lists â one for the current <span class='math'>$x$</span>&apos;s
color order and the other for all previous <span class='math'>$x$</span>&apos;s&apos; color order. To check the
ordering, we can compare the ordering of these two lists&apos; intersection, and then
merge the lists after processing <span class='math'>$x$</span> by using 2 pointers. Since the constraints
are so small, straightforward list insertion is fast enough for this.
<p>Sub-case 5 in the example does not satisfy this condition.
<p>Andi&apos;s code (which runs in <span class='math'>$\mathcal{O}(N^2M)$</span> time).

<p>Of course, it is possible to solve this problem in <span class='math'>$\mathcal{O}(NM)$</span> time,  but
it was not necessary to do so due to the low constraints.
