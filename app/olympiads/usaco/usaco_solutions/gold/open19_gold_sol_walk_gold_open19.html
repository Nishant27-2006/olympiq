(Analysis by Brian Dean)
<p>There are a few ways to approach this problem.  Probably the most
straightforward is a  binary search on the answer (say, <span class='math'>$x$</span>), where in each step
we preserve only the edges of cost <span class='math'>$&lt;x$</span> in our graph and count the number of
connected components.  If the number is less than <span class='math'>$K$</span>, then our guess for <span class='math'>$x$</span>
was too high.  Unfortunately, the running time here is <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> to find
connected components, times the number of steps in the  binary search, which is
the log of 2019201997 --- about 33.  This will likely time  out on large input
cases.
<p>The key structural insight is that the answer to this problem comes from a
minimum spanning tree (MST) of our graph.  If you want to split into <span class='math'>$K=2$</span>
clusters, you can do this by finding an MST and removing its highest-weight
edge, thereby splitting it into two pieces that  represent two sides of our
partition.  More generally, to split into <span class='math'>$K$</span> clusters, you just remove the
<span class='math'>$K-1$</span> highest-weight edges from the MST.  This makes sense if you think of the
operation of Kruskal&apos;s MST algorithm: consider the state of the algorithm when
it  has built up <span class='math'>$K$</span> connected components and is about to add an edge of weight
<span class='math'>$x$</span> to join the next pair of components together --- at this point, each
component is internally connected by a  spanning tree containing edges of weight
at most <span class='math'>$x$</span>, and running between these components are only edges of weight at
least <span class='math'>$x$</span> (otherwise components would have been joined earlier in the process).
<p>So we see that we can answer this question by taking the <span class='math'>$(K-1)$</span>th largest edge
weight in an MST, which means all we need to do is compute an MST.  There are
many MST algorithms out there, but unfortunately many of them (e.g., Kruskal,
Boruvka) run in <span class='math'>$O(N^2 \log N)$</span> time  for this problem since it involves a dense
graph.  Kruskal&apos;s algorithm can be modified to run in a dense graph in <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span>
time (left as an exercise to the reader), or we can note that the sorting step
is really the bottleneck with Kruskal, so we can sort the edges quickly (e.g.,
with something like a two-pass radix sort in linear time), after which Kruskal&apos;s
algorithm runs in nearly linear time.  Probably even better, however, would be 
to instead use Jarnik&apos;s algorithm (perhaps more commonly known as Prim&apos;s
algorithm, which is also pretty much equivalent to Dijkstra&apos;s shortest path
algorithm --- in the MST context, I prefer to call it Jarnik&apos;s algorithm since Jarnik&apos;s publication
pre-dated Prim&apos;s by a substantial amount).  This gives a simple way to build the
MST in just <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> time.
<p>Some mathematically enterprising students even managed to reverse-engineer our
&quot;random&quot; edge weight function to solve the problem without using algorithmic
methods --- although this was not the intent of the problem (and indeed, such
solutions would break if a different edge weight function was used), these
solutions were still awarded full marks.
<p>Here is my C++ code.  It basically runs Jarnik&apos;s algorithm to find an MST, then 
sorts the MST edges to find the right one.
