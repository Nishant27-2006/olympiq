(Analysis by Danny Mittal)
<p>For convenience, let <span class='math'>$S$</span> be the given string.
<p><strong>Subtask 1</strong> (<span class='math'>$|S| \leq 10$</span>)
<p>There are at most <span class='math'>$4^{10} \approx 10^6$</span> possible genomes, so we can just try
each one to see if it produces something consistent with the input after Farmer
John&apos;s edits. This runs in <span class='math'>$O(|S|4^{|S|})$</span>.
<p><strong>Subtask 2</strong> (<span class='math'>$|S| \leq 10^2$</span>)
<p>Consider dividing the result of Farmer&apos;s John&apos;s edits back into the substrings
of the genome after he had reversed them (but before he had concatenated them).
Such a division could only correspond to one starting genome, which we could get
by reversing the substrings back and concatenating them. However, not every
division is valid (corresponds to some starting genome). In order for a division
to be valid, it must satisfy two properties:
<p><ul><li> For any two consecutive substrings <span class='math'>$s$</span> and <span class='math'>$t$</span> in our division, the first
letter of <span class='math'>$s$</span> and the last letter of <span class='math'>$t$</span>, which were adjacent before Farmer John
reversed the substrings, must be equal in order for Farmer John to have split
the genome there. </li><li> Any substring <span class='math'>$s$</span> must not have two adjacent
letters within itself that are equal, because if it did, Farmer John would have
split the genome there as well. </li></ul>
<p>Given these conditions, we can solve this problem using DP. It is useful to
first compute a preliminary DP that for each substring <span class='math'>$S[j\ldots k]$</span> and
letters <span class='math'>$l, m$</span> computes the amount of ways to replace the question marks in
<span class='math'>$s[j\ldots k]$</span> with letters so that <span class='math'>$s[j\ldots k]$</span> starts with <span class='math'>$l$</span>, ends with
<span class='math'>$m$</span>, and satisfies our second condition, i. e. doesn&apos;t contain any two adjacent
equal letters. This DP is fairly straightforward to compute in <span class='math'>$O(|S|^2)$</span>.
<p>After that, we will perform our main DP, where for each index <span class='math'>$k$</span> and letter
<span class='math'>$l$</span>, we compute the number of divisions of <span class='math'>$S[1\ldots k]$</span> such that the last
substring in the division begins with <span class='math'>$l$</span>. To transition, we try each possible
ending index <span class='math'>$j$</span> of the previous substring in our division. By making use of our
preliminary DP values for <span class='math'>$s[j + 1\ldots k]$</span>, we can do this in constant time
for each <span class='math'>$(j, k)$</span>, making this DP, and thus the overall algorithm, <span class='math'>$O(|S|^2)$</span> as
well.
<p><strong>Subtask 3</strong> (<span class='math'>$|S| \leq 10^5$</span>)
<p>To solve this subtask, we will optimize our solution to the previous subtask.
<p>In our new DP, we will instead, for each <span class='math'>$k$</span>, count divisions of <span class='math'>$S[1 \ldots k]$</span>
which may be incomplete, in that the last letter of the last substring may not
match the first character of the second-to-last substring. This means that in
addition to keeping track of the first letter <span class='math'>$l$</span> of the last substring, we also
need to keep track of the last letter <span class='math'>$m$</span> of the last substring as well as the
first letter <span class='math'>$n$</span> of the second-to-last substring. We will refer to said DP value
as <span class='math'>$dp_{k, n, l, m}$</span>.
<p>The optimization comes from the transitions necessary for this DP. Instead of
going through all previous indexes <span class='math'>$j$</span>, our transition is either extending the
last substring in our division up to <span class='math'>$k - 1$</span> by one character, or adding a new
substring consisting of a single character to our division up to <span class='math'>$k - 1$</span>.
<p>In the first type of transition, the letters <span class='math'>$n$</span> and <span class='math'>$l$</span> stay the same, and the
last two letters in the substring we are extending must not be equal in order to
satisfy our second condition, so we simply add <span class='math'>$dp_{k - 1, n, l, m}$</span> to
<span class='math'>$dp_{k, n, l, m&apos;}$</span> for all <span class='math'>$n, l, m, m&apos;$</span> such that <span class='math'>$m \neq m&apos;$</span> and <span class='math'>$m&apos;$</span> is a
valid letter for <span class='math'>$S_k$</span>.
<p>In the second type of transition, the old values of <span class='math'>$n$</span> and <span class='math'>$m$</span> must match in
order to satisfy our first condition, so we add <span class='math'>$dp_{k - 1, m, l, m}$</span> to
<span class='math'>$dp_{k, l, m&apos;, m&apos;}$</span> for all <span class='math'>$m, l, m&apos;$</span> such that <span class='math'>$m&apos;$</span> is a valid letter for
<span class='math'>$S_k$</span>.
<p>To compute our final answer, we simply need to ensure that we have <span class='math'>$n = m$</span>, so
our answer is the sum over <span class='math'>$dp_{|S|, m, l, m}$</span> for all <span class='math'>$m, l$</span>.
<p>For each <span class='math'>$k$</span>, we compute at most <span class='math'>$4^4 + 4^3$</span> transitions, which is constant (and
still small enough), making our algorithm <span class='math'>$O(|S|)$</span>.
