(Analysis by Danny Mittal, Benjamin Qi)
<p>At any point in the drawing process, Bessie&apos;s drawing will always be one large
triangle whose interior is then divided into many smaller triangles by the
segments inside.
<p>To see this, first note that it is true after drawing the first three points,
because at that point we simply have a triangle with nothing inside. Then, for
each additional point that we draw, it either falls inside or outside of our
current triangle.
<p>If it falls inside, then it must fall inside one of the interior triangles,
which means that Bessie will draw segments from the new point to the three
vertexes of that interior triangle, replacing it with three even smaller
triangles. Note that this automatically satisfies the requirement that Bessie
draw exactly three new segments each time.
<p>If it falls outside, then Bessie could only connect the new point to the three
vertexes of the large triangle, so in order to satisfy the requirement, Bessie
must draw connecting segments to all of the vertexes. This will have the effect
of creating a new large triangle, composed of the previous large triangle as
well as two new interior triangles.
<p>Therefore, in order to satisfy the requirement, we need it to be true that
whenever we draw a point outside our current large triangle, this point can be
connected to all the vertexes of our current large triangle.
<p>We will thus compute the number of permutations via DP.
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> <span class='math'>$\mathcal{O}(N^5)$</span>
<p>If we look at the drawing process in the forward direction, all we need to keep
track of is the current large triangle and the number of points we&apos;ve drawn so
far. When adding a new point to the permutation, either it is contained within
the current large triangle and the large triangle remains the same, or it is
located outside the large triangle and all three vertices of the large triangle
are visible from it. There are <span class='math'>$\mathcal{O}(N^4)$</span> states and each of them can
transition to  <span class='math'>$\mathcal{O}(N)$</span> other states, so the overall time complexity is
<span class='math'>$\mathcal{O}(N^5)$</span>. As the constant factor is quite low, this solution runs well
below the time limit.

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> <span class='math'>$\mathcal{O}(N^4)$</span>
<p>Our DP will actually compute the answer by looking at the drawing process in
reverse. Our state will be the current large triangle, and we can  transition
from one large triangle to a smaller one if the smaller triangle shares two
vertexes with the larger one and its third vertex is contained in the larger
one.
<p><span class='math'>$dp_T$</span>, where <span class='math'>$T$</span> is a triangle, will be the number of valid orders in which
Bessie draws the points <strong>outside</strong> of <span class='math'>$T$</span> given that before drawing any of
those points, our large triangle was <span class='math'>$T$</span>.
<p>One important note is that in order for there to be any possible order at all,
there must be a triangle containing all <span class='math'>$N$</span> of our points. Let this triangle be
<span class='math'>$T_{\text{everything}}$</span> (if it doesn&apos;t exist, the answer is <span class='math'>$0$</span>). We then start
with <span class='math'>$dp_{T_{\text{everything}}} = 1$</span>.
<p>We now need to transition. Let&apos;s say that we&apos;re trying to compute <span class='math'>$dp_T$</span> for
some triangle <span class='math'>$T$</span>. As described previously, we can transition from all larger
triangles <span class='math'>$T&apos;$</span> such that <span class='math'>$T$</span> and <span class='math'>$T&apos;$</span> share two vertexes and the third vertex of
<span class='math'>$T$</span> is inside <span class='math'>$T&apos;$</span>. Then, <span class='math'>$dp_{T&apos;}$</span> counts the number of orders that Bessie can
draw the points outside of <span class='math'>$T&apos;$</span>. In order to compute <span class='math'>$dp_T$</span>, we must also
account for the points outside of <span class='math'>$T$</span> but inside <span class='math'>$T&apos;$</span>.
<p>Define <span class='math'>$P(a,b)=\frac{a!}{(a-b)!}$</span> to be the number of permutations of <span class='math'>$b$</span>
elements that we choose from a pool of <span class='math'>$a$</span> elements.
<p>Let there be <span class='math'>$x$</span> points outside <span class='math'>$T$</span> and <span class='math'>$y$</span> points outside <span class='math'>$T&apos;$</span>, so that there
are <span class='math'>$x - y - 1$</span> points outside <span class='math'>$T$</span> but inside <span class='math'>$T&apos;$</span> (because the third vertex of
<span class='math'>$T&apos;$</span>, which is outside of <span class='math'>$T$</span>, is neither inside nor outside of <span class='math'>$T&apos;$</span>). This
third vertex of <span class='math'>$T&apos;$</span> must be drawn before all <span class='math'>$x$</span> of the points outside <span class='math'>$T$</span>,
because otherwise we would have intermediate large triangles due to points
outside of <span class='math'>$T$</span> being drawn while <span class='math'>$T$</span> is still the large triangle. After the
third vertex is drawn and <span class='math'>$T&apos;$</span> is completed, the <span class='math'>$x - y - 1$</span> points between <span class='math'>$T$</span>
and <span class='math'>$T&apos;$</span> can be drawn whenever we want because they are inside <span class='math'>$T&apos;$</span> and thus
drawing them is always valid. Therefore, to transition, we need to count the
number of ways to mix these <span class='math'>$x - y - 1$</span> &quot;in between&quot; points with the <span class='math'>$y$</span> points
that are outside of <span class='math'>$T&apos;$</span>. This is just
<span class='math'>$P(x - y - 1 + y,x - y - 1) = P(x - 1,x - y - 1)$</span>, and so our transition becomes
<p><div class='math'>$$dp_T = dp_T + P(x-1,x-y-1) dp_{T&apos;}.$$</div>
<p>To compute the final answer, we iterate over which triangle is used as the first
three points that Bessie draws. If this triangle is <span class='math'>$T$</span>, and there are <span class='math'>$x$</span>
points outside of <span class='math'>$T$</span> as before, then Bessie first draws the three vertexes of
<span class='math'>$T$</span> (there are <span class='math'>$3! = 6$</span> ways to do this), then draws the points inside of <span class='math'>$T$</span> as
well as the points outside of <span class='math'>$T$</span>. The ways to draw the points outside of <span class='math'>$T$</span>
are counted by <span class='math'>$dp_T$</span>, so we simply need to mix in the points inside <span class='math'>$T$</span>. These
can be mixed in however we want as <span class='math'>$T$</span> is already drawn, so the number of ways
to mix them in is simply <span class='math'>$P(N - 3, N - 3 - x)$</span>.
Therefore, our final answer is
<p><div class='math'>$$\sum_{T\text{ is a triangle}} 6 \cdot P(N - 3, N - 3 - x) dp_T.$$</div>
<p>For the runtime, note that we have <span class='math'>$\mathcal O(N^3)$</span> triangles, and for each
triangle we only consider triangles that share two vertexes, of which there are
<span class='math'>$\mathcal O(N)$</span>, so the overall runtime is <span class='math'>$\mathcal O(N^4)$</span>.
