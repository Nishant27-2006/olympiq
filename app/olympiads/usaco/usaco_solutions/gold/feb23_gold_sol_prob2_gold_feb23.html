(Analysis by Rohin Garg)
<p><strong> Subtask 1: </strong> <span class='math'>$T = 0$</span>
<p>First, root the tree at node <span class='math'>$1$</span>. It is first important to observe that the
order of visited pastures is similar to one of a DFS starting at node <span class='math'>$1$</span>. This
is because a DFS order minimizes the total amount of time to visit all pastures.
The length a path traversed by a DFS is exactly <span class='math'>$2(n-1)$</span>, as it crosses each
edge exactly twice. Because each edge must be crossed at least twice to visit
the nodes in its subtree, this is a lower bound on the amount of time necessary,
proving its optimality.
<p>With this observation, what remains is to determine the order that Farmer John
visits the children of each node. Note that once this order is determined for
every node, the DFS order (and therefore the order that the pastures are
visited) is uniquely determined.
<p>Define <span class='math'>$dp_u$</span> as the minimum amount of fertilizer necessary to fertilize all
pastures in the subtree of <span class='math'>$u$</span>, such that the path starts at node <span class='math'>$u$</span> at time
<span class='math'>$t = 0$</span>, and also ends at node <span class='math'>$u$</span>. Let <span class='math'>$\text{size}_u$</span> be the size of the
subtree of node <span class='math'>$u$</span>, and <span class='math'>$\text{sum}_u$</span> be the sum of <span class='math'>$a_x$</span> over all nodes <span class='math'>$x$</span>
in the subtree of <span class='math'>$u$</span>. 
<p>If Farmer John visits the subtree of child <span class='math'>$v$</span> at time <span class='math'>$t$</span>, it takes
<span class='math'>$dp_v + \text{sum}_v \cdot t$</span> fertilizer. This is because, during the first <span class='math'>$t$</span>
seconds, the value of each pasture <span class='math'>$x$</span> in the subtree of <span class='math'>$v$</span> increased by <span class='math'>$a_v$</span>.
With this in mind, consider a fixed order of the children of node <span class='math'>$u$</span>, call it
<span class='math'>$v_1, v_2, \ldots v_k$</span>. The contribution of node <span class='math'>$v_i$</span> to <span class='math'>$dp_u$</span> in a particular
order is
<span class='math'>$dp_{v_i} + \text{sum}_{v_i} \cdot \left(1 + \sum\limits_{j = 0}^{i-1} 2 \cdot \text{size}_{v_j}\right)$</span>.
This directly follows from the previous observations, as the amount of time it
takes to visit the subtree of child <span class='math'>$v$</span> is
<span class='math'>$2 \cdot (\text{size}_v - 1) + 2 = 2 \cdot \text{size}_v $</span> (the extra <span class='math'>$2$</span> comes
from the time it takes to cross the edge <span class='math'>$(u, v)$</span>), with the <span class='math'>$1$</span> coming from
crossing the edge <span class='math'>$(u, v_i)$</span>. Therefore, we need to minimize the sum of this
quantity over all permutations of
<span class='math'>$v_1, v_2, \ldots v_k$</span>.
<p>Note that the sum of <span class='math'>$dp_{v_i}$</span> is constant, regardless of the order of the
children, as is the sum of <span class='math'>$\text{sum}_{v_i} \cdot 1$</span>. After moving the <span class='math'>$2$</span> out
of the summation, what remains is to minimize
<span class='math'>$\text{sum}_{v_i} \cdot \sum\limits_{j = 0}^{i-1} \text{size}_{v_j}$</span>. Consider
the case where there are two children: <span class='math'>$v_1$</span> and <span class='math'>$v_2$</span>. If <span class='math'>$v_1$</span> is placed
before <span class='math'>$v_2$</span>, the value of the expression is
<span class='math'>$\text{sum}_{v_1} \cdot 0 + \text{sum}_{v_2} \cdot \text{size}_{v_1} = \text{sum}_{v_2} \cdot \text{size}_{v_1}$</span>.
Similarly, if <span class='math'>$v_2$</span> is placed before <span class='math'>$v_1$</span>, the value of the expression is
<span class='math'>$\text{sum}_{v_1} \cdot \text{size}_{v_2}$</span>. Placing <span class='math'>$v_1$</span> before <span class='math'>$v_2$</span> is
therefore optimal if
<span class='math'>$\text{sum}_{v_2} \cdot \text{size}_{v_1} \leq \text{sum}_{v_1} \cdot \text{size}_{v_2}$</span>,
or equivalently
<span class='math'>$\frac{\text{size}_{v_1}}{\text{sum}_{v_1}} \leq \frac{\text{size}_{v_2}}{\text{sum}_{v_2}}$</span>.
To complete the solution, we must make use of an
<a href='https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs482/2007su/exchange.pdf'>exchange
argument.</a> Consider an optimal ordering of the children. Consider some
adjacent pair of children <span class='math'>$v_1$</span> and <span class='math'>$v_2$</span>. Using a similar argument as above, we
can show that if
<span class='math'>$\frac{\text{size}_{v_1}}{\text{sum}_{v_1}} \geq \frac{\text{size}_{v_2}}{\text{sum}_{v_2}}$</span>,
we can swap the order of children and the cost would improve or stay the same. Therefore,
an optimal solution must be sorted in non-decreasing order of
<span class='math'>$\frac{\text{size}_{v_i}}{\text{sum}_{v_i}}$</span>, completing the solution.
<p><strong> Subtask 2: </strong> <span class='math'>$T = 1$</span>
<p>The first key difference in this problem is that the minimum amount of time to
visit the pastures is no longer always <span class='math'>$2(n-1)$</span>. Recall that earlier, Farmer
John had to pass through each edge at least <span class='math'>$2$</span> times. However, let the last
node that Farmer John visits be <span class='math'>$v$</span>. Farmer John only has to pass through the
edges on the path from <span class='math'>$1$</span> to <span class='math'>$v$</span> exactly once. The number of these edges is
exactly the depth of <span class='math'>$v$</span> in the tree. Therefore, the amount of time it will take
him is <span class='math'>$2(n-1) - \text{depth}_v$</span>, so he must maximize the depth of the final
node in his path. 
<p>For each subtree, calculate a second dp value <span class='math'>$pd_u$</span>, defined similarly to the
initial dp with the extra restriction that it must end on a node with maximum
depth in the subtree. The answer to the problem is <span class='math'>$pd_1$</span>. 
<p>To calculate <span class='math'>$pd_u$</span>, iterate over the child <span class='math'>$v$</span> that is put last in the order
(making sure to only check nodes with maximum depth in their subtree). Note
that, from the same argument as earlier, the ordering for the rest of the nodes
can be determined. Let&apos;s compute the difference between <span class='math'>$dp_u$</span> and the cost of
moving node <span class='math'>$v$</span> to the end of the order. The contribution of <span class='math'>$v$</span> to the sum
becomes
<span class='math'>$pd_v + \text{sum}_v \cdot \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{\text{number of children}-1} 2 \cdot \text{size}_{v_i}$</span>,
which can be computed in constant time. The values of the children who initially
appeared before node <span class='math'>$v$</span> in the order remain the same, and the values of the
children who appeared after node <span class='math'>$v$</span> decrease by
<span class='math'>$2 \cdot \text{sum}_i \cdot \text{size}_v$</span>. This value can be computed with a
simple suffix sum, allowing us to calculate the value in constant time, allowing
us to calculate <span class='math'>$pd$</span> in linear time, solving the problem.
