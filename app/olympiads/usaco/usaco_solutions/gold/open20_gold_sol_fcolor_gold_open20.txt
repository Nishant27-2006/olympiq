If both cows

$b$

and

$c$

admire cow

$a$

then both

$b$

and

$c$

must have the same
color. From now on, we can treat both

$b$

and

$c$

as the same cow; change all
occurrences of

$c$

to

$b$

and merge the adjacency list of

$c$

into that of

$b$

.
Repeat this process while at least two distinct cows admire the same cow.

Once we reach a configuration in which a cow is admired by at most one cow this
process terminates; we can just assign every cow a distinct color. If we always merge the smaller adjacency list of the two
cows into the larger one then our solution runs in

$O((N+M)\log N)$

time. We
ensured that a few slow solutions did not pass but it is likely that many (not
necessarily provable) heuristics passed anyways.
