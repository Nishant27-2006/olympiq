(Analysis by Danny Mittal)
<p><strong>Subtask 1 (all numbers in input are at most <span class='math'>$100$</span>)</strong>
<p>We can simply simulate the process. There are <span class='math'>$Q \leq 100$</span> queries to test, each
of which involves walking at most <span class='math'>$d_i \leq 100$</span> units, and for each unit we
walk we can determine the direction we walk by keeping track of the time and
checking through all <span class='math'>$N \leq 100$</span> roads to see which ones we are on. This is
<span class='math'>$100^3 = 10^6$</span> checks which runs well in time.
<p><strong>Subtask 2 (<span class='math'>$N, Q \leq 3000$</span>)</strong>
<p>We can simulate the process more efficiently. Instead of walking one unit at a
time, we can walk until we reach a new cross street.
<p>To do this we will first create a sorted list of each type of road, then for
each query determine our starting position among each sorted list. For each step
we look in the sorted list corresponding to the direction that we are not
currently walking in and check the position of the following element, which
tells us how far we walk before potentially changing our direction. We can then
update our direction based on the time.
<p>As there are at most <span class='math'>$N$</span> roads, it takes <span class='math'>$O(N\lg N)$</span> time to create the sorted
lists. For each query it then takes <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> time to find our initial position in
each list and each subsequent step increases our position in one of the lists,
meaning that the number of steps is <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span>. The time complexity of this solution
is therefore <span class='math'>$O(N(\lg N + Q))$</span> which is fast enough.
<p><strong>Full solution</strong>
<p>Because John walks one unit per second, the amount of time has been walking is
equal to the distance that he has walked. This means that what direction he goes
next at an intersection depends on the parity of the distance he has walked thus
far. That distance in turn simply depends on his current position and his
starting position. Specifically, if he started at <span class='math'>$(x, y)$</span> and is now at
<span class='math'>$(a, b)$</span>, then he has walked <span class='math'>$(a - x) + (b - y)$</span> units, meaning that what
direction he goes next depends on the parity of <span class='math'>$(a - x) + (b - y)$</span>.
<p>For each query, <span class='math'>$x + y$</span> is either even or odd. We can assume that it is even,
and simply reproduce everything below analogously to handle the case where it is
odd.
<p>If <span class='math'>$x + y$</span> is even, then the parity of <span class='math'>$(a - x) + (b - y)$</span> is equal to the
parity of <span class='math'>$a + b$</span>. This means that which direction we go at an intersection
depends only on the position of the intersection itself.
<p>Consider separating the vertical roads into those located at even and odd
<span class='math'>$x$</span>-coordinates, and similarly separating the horizontal roads into those
located at even and odd <span class='math'>$y$</span>-coordinates. If John is currently walking on a
vertical road with even <span class='math'>$x$</span>-coordinate, and encounters a horizontal road with an
even <span class='math'>$y$</span>-coordinate, then his current position will have even <span class='math'>$a + b$</span>, meaning
that he will always walk north in such a case. On the other hand, if he
encounters a horizontal road with odd <span class='math'>$y$</span>-coordinate, he will switch to walking
east from that intersection.
<p>Thus, if Farmer John is currently walking on a vertical road with even
<span class='math'>$x$</span>-coordinate, he will walk until the first horizontal road he finds with odd
<span class='math'>$y$</span>-coordinate, then start walking on that road. Similarly, he will walk on that
road until the first vertical road with <em>odd</em> <span class='math'>$x$</span>-coordinate, and then walk
on <em>that</em> road until the first horizontal road with <em>even</em>
<span class='math'>$y$</span>-coordinate, which he then walks on until the first vertical road with even
<span class='math'>$x$</span>-coordinate.
<p>In this way Farmer John cycles through the four types of roads. This structure
has two useful properties:
<ul><li>John alternates between vertical and horizontal roads</li><li>If John is
currently on a vertical road, the next vertical road he walks on will have the
opposite parity, and it will be the earliest such road (and same for horizontal
roads)</li></ul>
<p>This suggests that we create a list of each type of road that doesn&apos;t contain
all such roads, but rather works as follows. The first road in each list is
simply the earliest (farthest southwest) road of each type, but every following
road is the first road after the current one that&apos;s of the opposite parity.
<p>Given this, if John is currently at an intersection of two roads that are both
in their respective lists, then he will always be on roads on the list because
of the second property mentioned above. This means that if we assume that John
ends up walking a certain amount of total roads, we can use the first property
to determine how many of each road he walks on and which direction he is walking
in at the end, then use the list to lookup the last roads he walks on. The
difference in the positions of those roads and the roads he begins on tells us
the distance he travelled in each direction to get to that point.
<p>We can then binary search the amount of roads he walks on, checking that he
doesn&apos;t travel too far to get to that last intersection and that the
intersection of the following pair of roads is sufficiently far away. After
completing that binary search, that last intersection, combined with the
direction he ends up in, will tell us the total distance he travels in each
direction.
<p>Finally, note that this requires Farmer John to start at the intersection of two
roads in the lists; he doesn&apos;t necessarily start at an intersection or at a road
on the list, but because of the second property we know that the second time he
walks on a certain type of road it&apos;ll be in the list, so we can use the strategy
of subtask 2 to walk him through four roads, at which point he&apos;ll be at such an
intersection.
<p>This solution requires <span class='math'>$O(N\lg N)$</span> precomputation to create both the lists for
subtask 2 and the lists used in the binary search, then requires an <span class='math'>$O(\lg N)$</span>
binary search for each query, making the runtime complexity <span class='math'>$O((N + Q)\lg N)$</span>
which is fast enough.
