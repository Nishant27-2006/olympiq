(Analysis by Danny Mittal)
<p>Visualize the cows and apples as being on a plane where position is the <span class='math'>$x$</span>-axis
and time is the <span class='math'>$y$</span>-axis. For a given cow that arrives at time <span class='math'>$t$</span> to position
<span class='math'>$x$</span>, the possible apples that that cow could catch are the ones landing at time
<span class='math'>$t&apos;$</span> at position <span class='math'>$x&apos;$</span> that satisfy <span class='math'>$t&apos; \geq t$</span> and <span class='math'>$|x&apos; - x| \leq |t&apos; - t|$</span>.
This region in the plane is a sort of infinite V shape with <span class='math'>$45$</span> degree angles
extending upwards from the point <span class='math'>$(x, t)$</span>.
<p>If we rotate the entire plane <span class='math'>$45$</span> degrees clockwise (transform each point
<span class='math'>$(x, t)$</span> to
<span class='math'>$(u, v) = \left(\frac {t + x} {\sqrt 2}, \frac {t - x} {\sqrt 2}\right)$</span>), then
those infinite V shapes become infinite squares, which means that the condition
for a cow <span class='math'>$(u, v)$</span> to be able to catch an apple <span class='math'>$(u&apos;, v&apos;)$</span> is simply <span class='math'>$u \leq u&apos;$</span>
and <span class='math'>$v \leq v&apos;$</span>. 
<p>Let&apos;s use that transformation. We can simply ignore the <span class='math'>$\sqrt 2$</span> factor as it
doesn&apos;t change the condition. For now, we will assume that <span class='math'>$n$</span> is <span class='math'>$1$</span>, so each
line of the input represents a single cow or apple.
<p>We can take a greedy approach to this problem. Consider the apple <span class='math'>$a$</span> with
smallest <span class='math'>$v$</span>, assuming that it can be caught by at least one cow, and out of all
cows that could catch it, consider the cow <span class='math'>$c$</span> with largest <span class='math'>$u$</span>. There is no
apple that <span class='math'>$c$</span> can catch that any other cow that can catch <span class='math'>$a$</span> cannot catch,
because all of them have <span class='math'>$u$</span> at most the <span class='math'>$u$</span> of <span class='math'>$c$</span>, and since they can all
catch <span class='math'>$a$</span>, all of them have a <span class='math'>$v$</span> not larger than the <span class='math'>$v$</span> of any apple that can
be caught at all. Therefore, it is optimal to assign <span class='math'>$c$</span> to catch <span class='math'>$a$</span>.
<p>Based on this greedy principle, we can devise an algorithm to solve this
problem. First, sort all the cows and all the apples by <span class='math'>$v$</span>. Now, for each apple
in increasing order of <span class='math'>$v$</span>, we will find the optimal cow to catch it. We will do
this by maintaining a BST (binary search tree) of the cows that have <span class='math'>$v$</span> at most
the <span class='math'>$v$</span> of the current apple, with the BST being sorted by <span class='math'>$u$</span>. For each apple
<span class='math'>$a$</span>, we will first add in all the cows with <span class='math'>$v$</span> at most the <span class='math'>$v$</span> of <span class='math'>$a$</span> that
haven&apos;t been added yet. Then, we will query our BSTs to find the cow in the BST
with the largest <span class='math'>$u$</span> such that the <span class='math'>$u$</span> is still small enough to catch <span class='math'>$a$</span>. If
there is such a cow, then we use it to catch <span class='math'>$a$</span>, meaning that we remove it from
the BST and increment our answer.
<p>This algorithm runs in <span class='math'>$\mathcal O(N\lg N)$</span> as we add and remove each cow
to/from the BST at most once, and we query the BST once for each apple.
<p>It remains to handle the fact that each line of the input can represent multiple
cows or apples. To handle this, we modify the part where we find the optimal cow
to catch each apple. We will instead repeatedly find the optimal group of cows
for the current group of apples, and assign as many cows as possible to apples.
At each step of this algorithm, either the group of cows will be exhausted, or
the group of apples will be exhausted. Therefore, the amount of steps is <span class='math'>$N$</span>,
and so this algorithm still runs in
<span class='math'>$\mathcal O(N\lg N)$</span>.
