<p>(Analysis by Bill Cooperman)</p><p>

An initial observation for many experienced contestants is that there can be no
more than 20 cows. Immediately this suggests some solution that is exponential
in <span class='math'>$n$</span>, possibly examining all subsets of cows. However, the order in which the
cows are stacked is important as well. Specifically, it can quickly be shown
that the optimal arrangement of cows might not be sorted in order of strength or
weight (this is left as an exercise to the reader). Luckily, the problem of
finding an optimal arrangement of some subset of the cows can be deconstructed
into several smaller sub-problems of the same type, so it is possible to
construct a dynamic programming solution.</p><p>

Let <span class='math'>$f(C)$</span> be the maximum possible strength factor for a stack of cows
consisting of exactly the subset <span class='math'>$C$</span> of all the cows. Then the solution to our
problem is just the maximum <span class='math'>$f(C)$</span> for all <span class='math'>$C$</span> where the sum of all the heights
of cows in <span class='math'>$C$</span> is at least <span class='math'>$H$</span>. Now, we just need to calculate <span class='math'>$f(C)$</span>.  If we let
<span class='math'>$f(\emptyset) =
\infty$</span> (analagous to the ground being able to support all the cows&apos; weights),
then we have the recurrence</p><p>

</p><div class='math'>$$
    f(C) = \max_{c \in C} \,\, \min \left(f(C \setminus c), \,\, S_c - \sum_{d \in (C
    \setminus c)} W_d \right)
$$</div><p></p><p>

Intuitively, we are trying to place each cow <span class='math'>$c \in C$</span> on the bottom of the
stack, and then placing the remaining set <span class='math'>$C \setminus c$</span> of cows
above <span class='math'>$c$</span>. The
straightforward implementation of this idea runs in <span class='math'>$O(n2^n)$</span> time (assuming the
sum of weights of cows in a subset is pre-computed), which is fast enough to get
full points.</p>
