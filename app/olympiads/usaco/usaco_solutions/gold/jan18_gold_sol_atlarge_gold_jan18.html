(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )
<p>In this problem we are given a rooted tree, where Bessie starts at the root, and
we must determine the minimum number of farmers, each starting at a leaf of the
tree, needed to ensure that Bessie cannot reach a leaf before she is caught.
<p>First observe that it is always optimal for Bessie to move away from the root of
the tree (assuming that she does not seek to delay her capture, when it proves
inevitable). If she were to move toward the root, then this means she is undoing
her previous move, which is a waste of time. Since Bessie has perfect
information (and infinite mental power), this situation would never arise.
<p>We can similarly observe that it is always optimal for farmers to move towards
the root of the tree. If a farmer is moving away from the root, he is either
moving away from Bessie, which is pointless, or Bessie is in his subtree, which
means that he will not be able to catch Bessie, so he may as well stay put.
<p>So every simple path from the root to a leaf defines a potential escape route.
The farmers&apos; moves are predetermined; Bessie knows this, so she will escape if
and only if there exists a feasible escape route. For an escape route to be
feasible, Bessie must be able to reach each point on the route before a farmer
reaches that same point. That is, every point on the route must be closer to the
root of the tree than to the nearest farmer-occupied leaf.
<p>Consider some arrangement of farmers for which Bessie has no feasible escape
routes. Consider any barn which is closer to the root than to the nearest leaf
(farmer-occupied or not). Then Bessie can reach this barn without being caught.
And for Bessie to be unable to escape, there must be a farmer in every child
subtree of this barn. Conversely, if every such barn has a farmer in every child
subtree, then Bessie obviously cannot escape.
<p>Thus, the number of farmers needed to thwart Bessie&apos;s escape is equal to the
number of barns which satisfy the following two conditions: - the barn&apos;s parent
is closer to the root than to the nearest leaf - but the barn itself is at least
as far from the root as from the nearest leaf.
<p>The second condition is needed to prevent double-counting.
<p>To count the number of barns satisfying the above conditions, we compute each
node&apos;s distance-to-root and distance-to-nearest-leaf. The former can be computed
for all nodes with a single depth-first search, and the latter can be computed
for all nodes with a breadth-first search starting at the leaves. Alternatively,
we can use a depth-first search to compute for each node the nearest leaf in its
subtree, and then use a second depth-first search to take care of leaves outside
the subtree.
<p>The latter method is implemented below.
