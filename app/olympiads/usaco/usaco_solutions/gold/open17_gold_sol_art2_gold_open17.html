For a color <span class='math'>$c$</span>, define <span class='math'>$S(c)$</span> as the first occurrence of <span class='math'>$c$</span> and <span class='math'>$E(c)$</span> as the
last occurrence of <span class='math'>$c$</span> in the input sequence.
<p>Our first task is to recover the left and right bounds of each painted interval.
For each color <span class='math'>$c$</span>, its interval must start at or before <span class='math'>$S(c)$</span> and end on or
after <span class='math'>$E(c)$</span>. In fact, we can assume the interval starts exactly at <span class='math'>$S(c)$</span> and
ends exactly on <span class='math'>$E(c)$</span>. To see why this is the case, note that if we had a
procedure to recreate the final painting that involves painting a longer
interval for <span class='math'>$c$</span>, we can substitute it with <span class='math'>$[S(c), E(c)]$</span> without changing the
end result.
<p>Now, letâs investigate which configurations are valid. If
<span class='math'>$S(A) &lt; S(B) &lt; E(A) &lt; E(B)$</span> for two colors A and B, we claim that the final
configuration is impossible. Indeed, if A were painted first, then E(A) cannot
have color A once B is painted. Similarly, we reach a contradiction assuming B
is painted first.
<p>Therefore, any two intervals <span class='math'>$[S(A), E(A)]$</span> and <span class='math'>$[S(B), E(B)]$</span> must be
completely disjoint, or one must be contained within the other. It follows that
the only colors that can appear inside an interval are the colors of the
intervals it contains. All such configurations are valid paintings since we can
always remove the shortest interval by painting it last. Suppose to the contrary
that the shortest interval contained the start/end of another interval. Then it
would have to contain that interval&apos;s end/start as well, and we have a
contradiction!
<p>Viewed another way, if we arrange all start and end points in order, replace
start points by open braces (of the corresponding color) and end points by close
braces (of the corresponding color), we must have a correct bracket sequence.
<p>Finally, let&apos;s look at our painting process in reverse. In the last step, we
paint (remove) all empty bracket sequences <span class='math'>$[]$</span>, and apply this procedure
recursively. This shows that our final answer is the maximum depth of the
bracket sequence.
<p>Here is Mark Chenâs code:
