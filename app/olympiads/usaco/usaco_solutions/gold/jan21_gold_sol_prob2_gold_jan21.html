(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )
<p>There&apos;s a fairly simple quadratic-time solution: let every cow be the vertex of
a graph, and say that there is a directed edge of weight <span class='math'>$|i-j|$</span> from cow <span class='math'>$i$</span> to
cow <span class='math'>$j$</span> if cow <span class='math'>$i$</span> is willing to talk to cow <span class='math'>$j$</span>. Then the cost of the shortest
path from cow <span class='math'>$1$</span> to cow <span class='math'>$N$</span> is precisely the answer, and we can find it with
e.g. Dijkstra&apos;s algorithm. However, since the graph has <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> edges, this is
too slow.
<p>That approach uses none of the structure of the original problem: that the edge
weights are linear, or that the number of types of cows is very small. Let&apos;s try
to use this structure to make a different graph with fewer edges that has the
same shortest-path costs.
<p>The physical intuition for a cost of <span class='math'>$|i-j|$</span> to transmit a message from cow <span class='math'>$i$</span>
to <span class='math'>$j$</span> is that the message travels <span class='math'>$1$</span> cow per unit time. Leveraging this
intuition, let&apos;s make a graph where each vertex encodes the location of the
message. Then in one timestep, the message can either move left by one, or right
by one. So we no longer have a quadratic number of edges.
<p>Of course, the location of the message is not quite enough information to
determine where it could go next. If we knew the cow who most recently sent the
message, that would be enough information: in one unit time, a message sent by
cow <span class='math'>$i$</span> can either move one unit away from cow <span class='math'>$i$</span>; or it can be &quot;received&quot; by
the cow at its current location if cow <span class='math'>$i$</span> is happy to talk to this cow. The
former edge updates the message&apos;s location, and the latter edge updates the
message&apos;s sender. Thus, this graph has <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> vertices (for every
location/sender pair) and <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> edges (<span class='math'>$2$</span> per vertex).
<p>Despite appearances, that is progress: we used the specifically chosen edge
weights to lower the degree of the graph to <span class='math'>$O(1)$</span>. It remains to decrease the
number of vertices, using the other symmetry of the problem: the small number of
cow breeds. The key is that we don&apos;t need to remember the sender, just the
sender&apos;s breed. Now we only have <span class='math'>$O(NK)$</span> vertices and <span class='math'>$O(NK)$</span> edges. Every edge
has weight either <span class='math'>$0$</span> or <span class='math'>$1$</span> (cost <span class='math'>$1$</span> to move left or right; cost <span class='math'>$0$</span> to be
received by the cow at the current location, if the breed matches the sending
breed). The shortest path from (cow <span class='math'>$1$</span>, breed of cow <span class='math'>$1$</span>) to (cow <span class='math'>$N$</span>, breed of
cow <span class='math'>$N$</span>) in this graph is (almost) the answer we need, and can be found by 0-1
BFS or Dijkstra&apos;s algorithm.
<p>There is one more catch: if the first and last cows are the same breed, this
graph will always output <span class='math'>$N-1$</span> as the shortest path, which may be incorrect if
this breed doesn&apos;t talk to itself. There are a number of ways to resolve this,
e.g. by changing the breed of cow <span class='math'>$N$</span> to a fake breed <span class='math'>$0$</span>, and remembering which
breeds of cows are willing to talk to cow <span class='math'>$N$</span>.

<p>Additional note (thanks to Justin Wu for suggesting that this be included): As
an alternative means of simplifying the graph, we can note that if the solution
includes a transition from a cow at index <span class='math'>$i$</span> to another cow (say,
of breed <span class='math'>$b$</span>), then without loss of generality we can assume this other cow is
one of the two cows of breed <span class='math'>$b$</span> closest to index <span class='math'>$i$</span> --- either the one
closest on the left or closest on the right (the only exception here is the transition to the final cow in the
last position).  
<p>One can argue this by taking an optimal path and noting that if any of its
transitions (except the last) do not fit this pattern, they can be modified
without penalty to fit the pattern. E.g., if the optimal solution goes from
index <span class='math'>$1$</span> to <span class='math'>$i$</span> to <span class='math'>$j$</span> to <span class='math'>$N$</span> and there is another cow of the same breed as the
one at position <span class='math'>$i$</span> between 1 and <span class='math'>$i$</span> (say at <span class='math'>$i&apos;$</span>), we loose nothing by
changing the first leg of the path so it moves from 1 to <span class='math'>$i&apos;$</span> (so now we have an
optimal solution that moves from <span class='math'>$1$</span> to <span class='math'>$i&apos;$</span> to <span class='math'>$j$</span> to <span class='math'>$n$</span>);  we then adjust the
next leg of the path the same way, and so on.
