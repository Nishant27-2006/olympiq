<p>(Analysis by Mark Gordon)</p><p>

Two cows must be in different lanes if one cow overtakes the other at
some point (or at the very end) in the jog.  Viewed this way we can
greedily assign all cows that are not overtaken by another cow during
the jog to lane 1.  We can then remove these cows and repeat the
algorithm to assign cows to the remaining lanes.</p><p>

To prove this is optimal suppose we assign $k$ lanes in total; then
there is some cow, $c_k$, in lane $k$ that is overtaken during the jog by
a cow in lane $k - 1$, $c_{k-1}$ (otherwise we would have assigned it to
lane $k - 1$ instead).  We can repeat this and find $c_{k-2}$ as the cow
that overtakes $c_{k-1}$ in lane k-2 all the way down to $c_1$.
Crucially, because the overtakes relation is transitive, it follows
that $c_i$ overtakes $c_j$ for $i < j$.  Therefore none of these cows can
be in the same lane and $k$ lanes are therefore required (and the greedy
algorithm mentioned achieves this).</p><p>

Efficiently implementing a solution based on this can be done in a
number of ways.  One way is to realize that the end positions of the
cows in $c$ are non-increasing while the start positions are
increasing.  Therefore we can simply compute the longest
non-increasing subsequence of the array.  This is a small adaptation
of the well known <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence'>Longest Increasing Subsequence</a> algorithm.</p><p>
