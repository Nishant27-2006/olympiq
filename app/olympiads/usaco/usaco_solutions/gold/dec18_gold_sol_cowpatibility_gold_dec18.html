(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>Instead of trying to count the number of pairs of cows that are not compatible,
we will count the number of pairs of cows that are compatible. The answer is
therefore <span class='math'>$\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$</span> minus the number of pairs of cows that are
compatible.
<p>The most direct approach of checking every pair of cows for compatibility takes
<span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> and will be too slow.
<p>The most naive <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> solution will loop over all pairs of cows and look for a
common flavor. This solution with no optimizations is unlikely to pass any
additional test cases. One way to optimize the <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> solution is to, for a
given ice cream flavor, keep track of every cow that likes that flavor, and to
then only loop over pairs of cows if they are known to share a common flavor. If
the cows&apos; favorite ice cream flavors are generated uniformly at random, this
solution performs really well, since any given flavor, for the given bounds,
will be liked by 0.25 cows in expectation.
<p>Fortunately, this optimized <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> solution does not pass all of the test
cases. However, it does motivate us towards the intended solution, which is
linear in <span class='math'>$N$</span>.
<p>Imagine for simplicity that the only flavors that are a favorite of at least 2
cows are flavor 1 and flavor 2. If we only count the number of pairs of cows
that like flavor 1 and the number of pairs of cows that like flavor 2, this is
an overestimate of the number of pairs of cows that are compatible because we
have double-counted by the number of pairs of cows that like both flavor 1 and
flavor 2.
<p>This motivates the following inclusion-exclusion solution: for every subset of
flavors, count how many pairs of cows that like all flavors within each subset.
We add all the counts for subsets of size 1, then to avoid double-counting, we
subtract all the counts for subsets of size 2. We then add all the counts of
subsets of size 3, subtract all the counts of subsets of size 4, and add the
counts of subsets of size 5.
<p>There are too many subsets of size 2 and more to iterate over directly, so we
can explicitly generate all the subsets of flavors where at least one cow likes
all the flavors in that subset. There are at most <span class='math'>$31N$</span> distinct such subsets.
<p>Below is Brian Dean&apos;s code.
