(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )
<p>We are given a collection of directories and files, and asked to find the
directory from which the sum of relative paths to files is minimized.
Abstractly, this is a graph problem: the collection of directories forms a tree,
where the files are special leaves of the tree, and there are two weights on
each edge. For instance, if the weight from node <span class='math'>$u$</span> to node <span class='math'>$v$</span> is <span class='math'>$w_{uv}$</span>,
this means that any relative path ending at <span class='math'>$u$</span> (but not passing through <span class='math'>$v$</span>)
must be extended by <span class='math'>$w$</span> characters to obtain a relative path for <span class='math'>$v$</span>. There is a
corresponding weight <span class='math'>$w_{vu}$</span>, which may not be equal to <span class='math'>$w_{uv}$</span>.
<p>So we want to find, for each node in the tree, the sum of path lengths from the
node to special leaves. Our answer will essentially be the minimum sum, although
depending on how exactly the weights are chosen, some care should be taken with
counting backslash characters correctly.
<p>Now the question is how to compute the sums. For each node, split the sum into
an up-sum and a down-sum, where the down-sum counts paths to special leaves in
the node&apos;s subtree, and the up-sum counts paths to all other special leaves.
Then the down-sum of a node is almost equal to the sum over all its children of
their down-sums: every special leaf in the node&apos;s subtree is counted by exactly
one of the children. So we must simply account for how much each path increased.
For a particular child, all paths in its subtree increased by the weight of the
(directed) edge from the node to the child. This means that given the number of
special leaves in each child&apos;s subtree, and the down-sum of each child, we can
compute the down-sum of the parent node. Therefore we can compute all down-sums
in a single depth-first search.
<p>We can compute the up-sums in a second depth-first search, as follows. Fix some
node <span class='math'>$u$</span> with parent <span class='math'>$p$</span>. Every special leaf not in the subtree of <span class='math'>$u$</span> is either
not in the subtree of <span class='math'>$p$</span>, or in the subtree of a different child of <span class='math'>$u$</span>. So the
up-sum of <span class='math'>$u$</span> can be computed from the up-sum of <span class='math'>$p$</span> (for the first case), the
down-sum of <span class='math'>$p$</span> minus the contribution of <span class='math'>$u$</span> to this down-sum (for the second
case), and the weight of the (directed) edge from <span class='math'>$u$</span> to <span class='math'>$p$</span> (since all paths
increase by this length when extended from <span class='math'>$p$</span> to <span class='math'>$u$</span>), and the number of special leaves not in the subtree of <span class='math'>$p$</span> (since this is the number of paths whose lengths increase by that weight).
