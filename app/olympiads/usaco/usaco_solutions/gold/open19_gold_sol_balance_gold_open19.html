(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )
<p>To understand how many swaps are needed to balance the number of inversions in
each subarray, we first need to understand how a swap changes the number of
inversions in each subarray. In particular, we&apos;re interested in the quantity
<span class='math'>$\Delta = \text{# inversions in first half} - \text{# inversions in second half}$</span>.
<p>Call a swap between the <span class='math'>$n$</span>-th and <span class='math'>$(n+1)$</span>-st elements of the array a &quot;central&quot;
swap. Any non-central swap either increases or decreases <span class='math'>$\Delta$</span> by <span class='math'>$1$</span>.
Furthermore, a central swap of the form <span class='math'>$1,0 \to 0,1$</span> increases <span class='math'>$\Delta$</span> by a
fixed amount: <span class='math'>$\text{# ones in array} - n$</span>. And a central swap of the form
<span class='math'>$0,1 \to 1,0$</span> decreases <span class='math'>$\Delta$</span> by the same amount.
<p>Suppose that we use no central swaps. Then we need to perform at least
<span class='math'>$|\Delta|$</span> swaps. It turns out that this is sufficient: in the subarray with
more inversions, we can always perform swaps to decrease the number of
inversions.
<p>Notice that any sequence of swaps can be interpreted as moving around the <span class='math'>$1$</span>s
in the array. Any optimal sequence never swaps two <span class='math'>$1$</span>s, and the path traced out
by each <span class='math'>$1$</span> is monotonic. So if the sequence increases the number of <span class='math'>$1$</span>s in the
first half by <span class='math'>$t$</span> (some integer, possibly negative), then it&apos;s optimal to
perform <span class='math'>$|t|$</span> central swaps (all of them moving <span class='math'>$1$</span>s in the same direction).
<p>So let&apos;s try <span class='math'>$t = 0, 1, 2, \dots$</span> in order (the cases <span class='math'>$t&lt;0$</span> are similar). As <span class='math'>$t$</span>
increases, we push more and more <span class='math'>$1$</span>s from the first half of the subarray to the
second half. Each push has three components: 
<p>1) non-central swaps in the first half, to move the <span class='math'>$1$</span> to position <span class='math'>$n$</span> 
<p>2) non-central swaps in the second half, to make sure that there&apos;s a <span class='math'>$0$</span> at
position <span class='math'>$n+1$</span>
<p>3) a single central swap moving the <span class='math'>$1$</span> from position <span class='math'>$n$</span> to the now-empty
position <span class='math'>$n+1$</span>
<p>Note that for a fixed <span class='math'>$t$</span>, these swaps are all necessary: we moved each <span class='math'>$1$</span> as
little as possible while still having <span class='math'>$t$</span> central swaps.
<p>We need to track <span class='math'>$\Delta$</span> through each push. We use a two-pointers approach: one
pointer in the first half of the array, pointing to the rightmost <span class='math'>$1$</span>. And one
pointer in the second half of the array, pointing to the leftmost <span class='math'>$0$</span>. These
pointers allow us to easily compute the number of non-central swaps forced by
the push, and thus the change in <span class='math'>$\Delta$</span>. As we&apos;ve shown above, the effect of
the central swap is also straightforward.
<p>Finally, suppose we know the value of <span class='math'>$\Delta$</span> after <span class='math'>$t$</span> central swaps (and the
associated pushes). Then as in the <span class='math'>$t = 0$</span> case, we need <span class='math'>$|\Delta|$</span> more
non-central swaps to balance the number of inversions (this is in addition to
the &quot;forced&quot; swaps). As <span class='math'>$t$</span> increases, we simply track the best number of swaps
found so far.
<p>Since each pointer is monotonic, the overall time complexity is <span class='math'>$O(n)$</span>.
<p>This solution implements the above idea. It handles the <span class='math'>$t &lt; 0$</span> cases by
viewing the sequence of swaps as moving the <span class='math'>$0$</span>s rather than moving the <span class='math'>$1$</span>s. This allows the above <span class='math'>$t \geq 0$</span> logic to be reused.
