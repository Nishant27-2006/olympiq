(Analysis by Dhruv Rohatgi)
<p>Let&apos;s first suppose that <span class='math'>$L=1$</span>. As a first attempt, consider some sort of
dynamic programming where for each index <span class='math'>$i \leq N$</span>, we count the number of ways
to validly partition the first <span class='math'>$i$</span> letters of the input string (i.e. the number
of partitions so that each subsequence is a string <span class='math'>$MO\cdots O$</span> with at most <span class='math'>$k$</span>
<span class='math'>$O$</span>&apos;s). If we could compute this for all <span class='math'>$i$</span>, then the value for <span class='math'>$i = N$</span> would
be our answer. Unfortunately, it&apos;s not immediately obvious how to use the value
at <span class='math'>$i$</span> to help compute the value at <span class='math'>$i+1$</span>, since if the letter at index <span class='math'>$i+1$</span> is
an <span class='math'>$O$</span>, then for any valid partition of the first <span class='math'>$i$</span> letters, the number of
ways to assign the new letter to an existing subsequence depends on how many of
these subsequence have strictly less than <span class='math'>$k$</span> <span class='math'>$O$</span>&apos;s, which could vary based on
the partition. We could try to augment the dynamic programming state with this
information (e.g. for each <span class='math'>$m$</span>, count the number of valid partitions where
exactly <span class='math'>$m$</span> subsequences have less than <span class='math'>$k$</span> <span class='math'>$O$</span>&apos;s), but computing these dynamic
programming values would seem to require yet more information. We are looking
for a roughly linear-time solution, so this approach does not seem promising.
<p>Intuitively, the difficulty arises because for any particular prefix, each <span class='math'>$M$</span>
that we have seen so far  can be in any of <span class='math'>$k+1$</span> different &quot;states&quot;, depending
on how many <span class='math'>$O$</span>&apos;s have been assigned to it so far, and this affects the
combinatorics of the unseen suffix, so the dynamic programming state in a
forward-pass algorithm seemingly must include a histogram of how many <span class='math'>$M$</span>&apos;s are
in each state. This suggests reversing our perspective. In a back-to-front
algorithm, where we count the number of valid partitions of each suffix, each
<span class='math'>$O$</span> can only be in one of two states (assigned to an <span class='math'>$M$</span>, or not), so
intuitively all that we need to update our counts is the number of unassigned
<span class='math'>$O$</span>&apos;s in the suffix. Moreover, this is always the total number of <span class='math'>$O$</span>&apos;s in the
suffix, minus <span class='math'>$k$</span> times the total number of <span class='math'>$M$</span>&apos;s in the suffix, irrespective of
the partition!
<p>More formally, suppose we have computed <span class='math'>$V_i$</span>, the number of ways to partition
the last <span class='math'>$i$</span> letters so that all but one subsequence are strings <span class='math'>$MO\cdots O$</span>
with exactly <span class='math'>$k$</span> <span class='math'>$O$</span>&apos;s, and the remaining subsequence is the unused <span class='math'>$O$</span>&apos;s. To
compute <span class='math'>$V_{i+1}$</span> there are two cases. If the <span class='math'>$i+1$</span>-st letter from the end is an
<span class='math'>$O$</span>, then <span class='math'>$V_{i+1} = V_i$</span> since this letter cannot be used yet. Otherwise,
<span class='math'>$V_{i+1} = \binom{O_i - kM_i}{k} V_i$</span>, since for each valid partition of the
last <span class='math'>$i$</span> letters, there are <span class='math'>$\binom{O_i - kM_i}{k}$</span> ways to choose <span class='math'>$k$</span> <span class='math'>$O$</span>&apos;s
from the unused <span class='math'>$O$</span>&apos;s. Here, <span class='math'>$O_i$</span> is the number of <span class='math'>$O$</span>&apos;s in the last <span class='math'>$i$</span>
letters, and <span class='math'>$M_i = i-O_i$</span> is the number of <span class='math'>$M$</span>&apos;s in the last <span class='math'>$i$</span> letters. This
gives an <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> time algorithm so long as we can efficiently compute the needed
binomial coefficients. While this algorithm is most naturally expressed via a
reverse pass through the input data, it can just as easily be implemented in a
forward pass by maintaining the value <span class='math'>$O_i - kM_i$</span>; see the code below.
<p>There are several ways to compute the needed binomial coefficients efficiently.
One way, which suffices for this problem, is to precompute all factorials up to
<span class='math'>$N!$</span> (all modulo <span class='math'>$p = 10^9 + 7$</span>). We can then compute any given binomial
coefficient <span class='math'>$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$</span> efficiently by using Fermat&apos;s
little theorem for the modular inverses: <span class='math'>$a^{p-2} \equiv a^{-1} \bmod{p}$</span> for
any <span class='math'>$1\leq a &lt; p$</span> and prime <span class='math'>$p$</span>. Since <span class='math'>$p$</span> is large, we need to use fast
exponentiation (i.e. repeated squaring) to compute the quantities
<span class='math'>$a^{p-2} \bmod{p}$</span>.
<p>This is a complete solution for <span class='math'>$L=1$</span>. To extend to general <span class='math'>$L$</span>, it suffices to
notice that no subsequence can cross between two different repeats of the input
string: for example, if some subsequence starting in the second-to-last repeat
used an <span class='math'>$O$</span> in the last repeat, then the last repeat would not have enough <span class='math'>$O$</span>&apos;s
for all of its <span class='math'>$M$</span>&apos;s; this argument generalizes. Thus, the answer for general
<span class='math'>$L$</span> is equal to the answer for <span class='math'>$L=1$</span>, raised to the <span class='math'>$L$</span>-th power. We can compute
this quantity using fast exponentiation.
