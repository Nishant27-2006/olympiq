(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )

We essentially solve this problem with the two-pointers method and a bit of
additional data structures.

Sort the boots and tiles by depth of snow, and maintain a doubly-linked list
initially containing all the tiles. Iterate through the boots in order of
decreasing snow resistance. For each boot, keep removing the tiles with the most
snow from the doubly-linked list until the current pair of boots can withstand
the depth of snow on all tiles in the linked list.

Then these boots are feasible for Farmer John if and only if the maximum
distance between any adjacent pair of tiles in the linked list is no greater
than the maximum distance which these boots can step. And as we remove tiles
from the linked list, we can maintain this maximum distance: if it changes upon
removing a tile, it must now be equal to the distance between the predecessor
and successor of the deleted tile in the list.

This yields an

$O(N\log N + B \log B)$

algorithm dominated by the cost of
sorting.
