(Analysis by Nick Wu)

In this problem, we have a list of entries where each cow produced some amount
of milk, and we need to use the entries to determine which cow produced the
second-smallest amount of milk.

There are a couple parts to the problem. The first part is to read in the list
of entries and determine the total amount of milk each cow produced. There are a
few ways to maintain this information. In the provided model solution, we keep
an array of the names of all the cows and maintain a parallel array with the
amount of milk that the cow has produced.

After we have computed how much milk each cow has produced, we need to compute
the second smallest amount of milk that any cow has produced. We can start by
computing the minimum amount of milk that any cow has produced. The second
smallest amount of milk that any cow has produced is therefore the next smallest
amount of milk present.

After we have computed that quantity, we need to determine which cows have
produced that amount of milk. We can loop over all the cows - if a cow produces
that amount, then if we haven't found any other cows, then that cow is
considered to be the only cow that has produced that amount of milk. Otherwise,
there is a tie.
