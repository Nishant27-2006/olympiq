(Analysis by Spencer Compton)
<p>To solve this problem, we will implement a process that can figure out when a
cow was born, given a phrase about when it was born in relation to another cow
whose time of birth we already know.
<p>As specified in the problem statement, each phrase will tell us when a new cow
was born in relation to a previously mentioned cow. We will use this information
to figure out exactly when the new cow was born in relation to Bessie. Since we
do this, whenever we receive a phrase we can assume we have already figured out
when the previously mentioned cow was born in relation to Bessie. 
<p>Now, we figure out how to determine when a cow was born given a phrase. Suppose
we are told &quot;Mildred born in next Dragon year from Bessie&quot;, how can we figure
out exactly when Mildred was born? We can start by setting Mildred&apos;s birth year
to one later than Bessie&apos;s birth year. Then, we can continue to increase
Mildred&apos;s birth year until it is a Dragon year! We could use a similar approach
if we were told Mildred was born in some previous year (we would decrease
repeatedly instead of increase repeatedly). 
<p>The main remaining challenge is to implement some function that lets us check
what type of year  a particular year is. There are a few ways we can do this. One way
is to look at the difference between the year and Bessie&apos;s birth year modulo 12
and check if it matches what it should be for the type of year mentioned in the
phrase. Another way is to start at Bessie&apos;s birth year and change it one year at
a time (keeping track of what type of year it is) until it is the given year, and
then checking what type of year it is (as is done in the code below).

  return animals[a];
}

    when_born[cowa] = when_born[cowb];
    do {
      if (relation == &quot;previous&quot;) when_born[cowa]--;
      else when_born[cowa]++;
    } while (get_animal(when_born[cowa]) != animal);
  }
  int diff = when_born[&quot;Bessie&quot;] - when_born[&quot;Elsie&quot;];
  if (diff &lt; 0) diff = -diff;
  cout &lt;&lt; diff &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
