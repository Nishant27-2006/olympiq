(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>In this problem, we have a fence and two sections of the fence have been
painted. We need to determine how much of the fence has been painted. We will
present two solutions to this problem. 
<p>The first solution that we will present relies on the fact that at most 100
units of the fence will be painted. We can loop over each unit of the fence and
see if that unit of the fence is inside one of the painted segments, and then
count how many such units there are.
<p>The second solution relies on the fact that there are exactly two segments that
were painted, but does not depend on how long those segments are. There are two
cases to consider here:
<p>Case 1: The two segments do not overlap at all.
<p>Case 2: The two segments do overlap by at least one unit.
<p>First, we need to decide if the two segments overlap. Assume without loss of
generality that <span class='math'>$a \le c$</span> (otherwise we can swap the segments so this is true). If <span class='math'>$c \ge b$</span>, then the two segments do not overlap
and the answer is simply the sum of the lengths of the two segments.
<p>Otherwise, if the two segments overlap, then it matters if <span class='math'>$d &gt; b$</span>. If <span class='math'>$d &gt; b$</span>,
then the section of fence from <span class='math'>$a$</span> to <span class='math'>$d$</span> is painted and the answer is <span class='math'>$d-a$</span>,
otherwise the section of fence from <span class='math'>$a$</span> to <span class='math'>$b$</span> is painted and the answer is
<span class='math'>$b-a$</span>.
<p>Here is my code implementing the first solution:
<p><pre class='prettyprint'>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
public class paint {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		// initialize file I/O
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;paint.in&quot;));
		PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;paint.out&quot;)));

		// read in the first line, store a and b
		StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
		int a = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		int b = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());

		// read in the second line, store c and d
		st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
		int c = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		int d = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());

		int amountPainted = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
			if(i &gt;= a &amp;&amp; i+1 &lt;= b) {
				amountPainted++;
			}
			else if(i &gt;= c &amp;&amp; i+1 &lt;= d) {
				amountPainted++;
			}
		}
		
		// print the answer!
		pw.println(amountPainted);

		// close output stream
		pw.close();
	}
}
