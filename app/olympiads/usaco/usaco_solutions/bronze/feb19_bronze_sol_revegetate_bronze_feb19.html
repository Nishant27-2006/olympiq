(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )
<p>In this problem, we have a graph where the vertices are pastures, and there is
an edge between two pastures if those two pastures are the favorites of some
cow. We want to color each vertex with one of <span class='math'>$4$</span> colors so that no two adjacent
vertices (i.e. no two vertices connected by an edge) are given the same color.
<p>So let&apos;s just assign colors to the vertices in order. For each vertex, we need
to find a color which has not already been assigned to any adjacent vertices.
Luckily, in our case this is always possible: the problem statement guarantees
that no vertex is adjacent to more than <span class='math'>$3$</span> other vertices, so at least one of
the <span class='math'>$4$</span> colors is free. Thus, we will always be able to find a coloring with
this strategy. The complexity is <span class='math'>$O(NM)$</span> if implemented naively, and could easily
be reduced to <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> by storing for each vertex the identities of the <span class='math'>$\leq 3$</span>
adjacent vertices. However, for the given constraints, this optimization is unnecessary.
<p>Brian Dean&apos;s code is below.
