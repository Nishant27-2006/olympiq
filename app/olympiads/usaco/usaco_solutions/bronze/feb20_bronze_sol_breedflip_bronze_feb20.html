(Analysis by Jonathan Paulson, Benjamin Qi)
<p>This is a greedy problem. There&apos;s not an obvious brute force to try; there are
too many ways to flip different substrings in different orders. But if you just
play around with a few examples, it&apos;s pretty easy to solve them by hand. To
solve the problem, you need to guess a rule for how to solve them, convince
yourself that it&apos;s right, and then code it. Greedy problems can be dangerous,
because it can be easy to convince yourself something is right even if it
actually doesn&apos;t work. The reward is that they&apos;re usually easier to code.
<p>In this case, I first simplified the problem by observing that it doesn&apos;t matter
what order you flip substrings in. All that matters is how many times each cow
gets flipped. So let&apos;s assume we do the flips from left to right (sorted by the
first cow they flip).
<p>Now imagine scanning through the string from left to right. Whenever you find a
mismatch, you have to fix it right now (because we just said we won&apos;t go
backwards). So we definitely have to start a flip at this cow. Where should we
end the flip? We should definitely keep going as long as there&apos;s mismatches,
since it&apos;s free to fix these in the same flip. But once we get to a
currently-matching cow, we should stop. Why? Because if we flip that cow, we&apos;ll
immediately need to flip it again on the very next move. And any useful flip we
wanted to do as part of this move, we could&apos;ve just done as part of that move.
So it never saves us any moves to keep going.
<p>This gives us a pretty simple solution; just flip all the ranges of mismatching
cows. We can count how many ranges there are with one pass through the strings -
just count the number of positions that *start* a mismatch.

<p>C++ code (from Jonathan Paulson):
<pre class='prettyprint'>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

int main() {
  freopen(&quot;breedflip.in&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, stdin);
  freopen(&quot;breedflip.out&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, stdout);
  ll n;
  cin &gt;&gt; n;
  string A;
  string B;
  cin &gt;&gt; A &gt;&gt; B;
  ll ans = 0;
  bool mismatched = false;
  for(ll i=0; i&lt;n; i++) {
    if(A[i] != B[i]) {
      if(!mismatched) {
        mismatched = true;
        ans++;
      }
    } else {
      mismatched = false;
    }
  }
  cout &lt;&lt; ans &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre>
<p>Java code (from Nick Wu). The Java code follows a different rule than the one
described above. It works just as well though. See if you can work out why.
<pre class='prettyprint'>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
public class Solution {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;breedflip.in&quot;));
    PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;breedflip.out&quot;)));
    int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
    char[] a = br.readLine().toCharArray();
    char[] b = br.readLine().toCharArray();
    int ret = 0;
    while(!new String(a).equals(new String(b))) {
      ret++;
      int lhs = 0;
      while(a[lhs] == b[lhs]) lhs++;
      int rhs = n-1;
      while(a[rhs] == b[rhs]) rhs--;
      for(int i = lhs; i &lt;= rhs; i++) {
        if(a[i] == &apos;G&apos;) a[i] = &apos;H&apos;;
        else a[i] = &apos;G&apos;;
      }
    }
    pw.println(ret);
    pw.close();
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Another way to view the problem:
<p>Place additional H&apos;s before and after both strings. Now define 
<div class='math'>$$A_{dif}[i]=\begin{cases}
1 &amp; A[i] \neq A[i+1] \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}$$</div>
and define <span class='math'>$B_{dif}$</span> similarly. We want to convert <span class='math'>$B_{dif}$</span> to <span class='math'>$A_{dif}$</span>, and
each modification to <span class='math'>$B$</span> changes exactly two elements of <span class='math'>$B_{dif}$</span>. Thus, the
answer is just the number of indices <span class='math'>$i$</span> such that <span class='math'>$A_{dif}[i]\neq B_{dif}[i]$</span>
divided by two (as the numbers of ones in <span class='math'>$A_{dif}$</span> and <span class='math'>$B_{dif}$</span> are always
even, this is guaranteed to be an integer).
