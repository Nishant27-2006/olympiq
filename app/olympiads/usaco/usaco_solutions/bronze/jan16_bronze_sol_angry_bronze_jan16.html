(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>In this problem, we have a set of hay bales placed along the number line and we wish to explode
as many of them as possible. When a hay bale explodes, it causes all subsequent hay bales caught in
its explosion to explode at a slightly larger radius, possibly causing a huge chain reaction.
<p>Because the number of hay bales is small, we can simulate the chain reaction of hay bales for every
possible hay bale.
<p>When we simulate the process for a single hay bale exploding, we can separate the explosion into
two separate explosions, one that goes to the left along the number line and one that goes to
the right on the number line. For the explosion that goes to the left, if it causes any hay bales to
its left to explode, we only have to consider the portion of that hay bale&apos;s explosion that goes
to the left. This is because the radius increases by 1, but the hay bale that just exploded
had to be to the left of the prior hay bale by at least 1.
<p>Because of this, when a hay bale explodes, we can fix the direction of the explosion. For a given hay bale,
we can find the hay bale furthest from it that would be caught in the explosion. After we have done that,
we can then simulate that hay bale exploding with an increased radius.
<p>Here is my Java code demonstrating this.
