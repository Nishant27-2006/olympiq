<p>(Analysis by Jonathan Paulson - <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c9a3a6a7a8bda1a8a7b9a8bca5baa6a789aea4a8a0a5e7aaa6a4">[email&#160;protected]</a>)</p><p>

The main difficulty here is that <span class='math'>$A$</span> and <span class='math'>$B$</span> are so large we cannot consider each new cow separately. We have to batch them up somehow.</p><p>

Imagine each cow as a point on a number line (corresponding to its weight). Each new cow has (at most) one neighbor to the left and one neighbor to the right, so either a new cow has one nearest neighbor, or it is exactly between two old cows.</p><p>

So each old cow &quot;covers&quot; some range on the number line where it is the nearest neighbor, depending on the cow to it&apos;s left and right (i.e. the next lighter and next heavier cow). By counting up how many new cows each old spotted cow covers, we&apos;ll get our answer.</p><p>

Coding this up is tough. There are a lot of possible off-by-one errors. In the rest of the analysis, I&apos;ll walk through how I coded it.</p><p>

First off: the easiest way to consider a cow and it&apos;s neighbors at the same time is to sort them, so let&apos;s do that. A nice way to avoid edge cases is to add extra old cows at the beginning and the end so that each cow has two neighbors; if we put these extra cows far enough out, they won&apos;t affect anything.</p><p>

I thought it was easiest to consider each neighboring pair of cows separately. Let <span class='math'>$S$</span> (S for &quot;start&quot;) be the weight of the cow on the left and let <span class='math'>$E$</span> (E for &quot;end&quot;) be the weight of the cow on the right. We want to handle the interval <span class='math'>$[S+1, E]$</span> (notice we handle the right endpoint but not the left endpoint; this way, our ranges add up to the whole interval with no point counted twice or uncounted).</p><p>

Let <span class='math'>$M = \frac{S+E}{2}$</span> (M for &quot;middle&quot;). Then the left cow covers the interval <span class='math'>$[S+1, M]$</span> and the right cow covers the interval <span class='math'>$[M+1, E]$</span>. But not every point is a new cow: we need to intersect these intervals with <span class='math'>$[A, B]$</span>. So really, the left cow covers the interval <span class='math'>$[max(S+1, A), min(M, B)]$</span>, and the right cow covers the interval <span class='math'>$[max(M+1, A), min(E, B)]$</span>. So if the left cow is spotted, add the left interval. If the right cow is spotted, add the right interval.</p><p>

Whew! Actually, we&apos;ve made one mistake: do you see it? We didn&apos;t consider the case where <span class='math'>$M$</span> was right in the middle (if <span class='math'>$S$</span> and <span class='math'>$E$</span> are both even or both odd, <span class='math'>$M$</span> is right in the middle; otherwise, <span class='math'>$M$</span> is in the left interval where we put it). If <span class='math'>$M$</span> is right in the middle, and the left cow is not spotted and the right cow is spotted *and* <span class='math'>$M$</span> is a new cow, then we didn&apos;t count <span class='math'>$M$</span> and we should have.</p><p>

Here&apos;s my C++ code, which follows the description above closely:
