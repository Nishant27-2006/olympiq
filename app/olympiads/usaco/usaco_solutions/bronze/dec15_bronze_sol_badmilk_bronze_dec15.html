(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>In this problem we&apos;re given a list of the types of milk that each guest drank,
when they drank each type, and when/if they got sick. Using this information we
want to determine how many people may become sick given that exactly one type of milk
is bad and making people sick.
<p>To solve this problem we want to identify which types of milk could be the bad milk.
We are explicitly told that a type of milk can be bad if, for every person that
got sick, each person drank that type of milk before they got sick. Therefore,
we loop over each sick person and ensure that they drank the candidate type of milk
prior to getting sick.
<p>Then to find the maximum number of guests who could become sick we want to find the maximum
number of people who drank one of these candidate bad milks.
<p>Here is my code documenting the given solution:
