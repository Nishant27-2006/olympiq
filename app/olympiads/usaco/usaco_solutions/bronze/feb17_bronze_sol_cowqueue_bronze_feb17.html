(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>In this problem, we have several cows who are lining up to enter Farmer John&apos;s farm.
Each cow enters the line at some time and requires some amount of questioning
before being allowed to enter the farm. We want to know when every cow has entered the farm.
<p>Intuitively, if we know the order that each cow arrives in, we can process the cows in that
order. We can track when their questioning starts - it&apos;s the later of their arrival time and
when the questioning of the previous cow ended.
<p>Given the above, it remains to figure out the order in which the cows appear. For this, while
we haven&apos;t yet processed all the cows, we can find the cow that has arrived the earliest
and process that cow next.
