(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )
<p>Notice that if the counter is a positive number <span class='math'>$i$</span> on some day, then the
counter must be <span class='math'>$i-1$</span> on the previous day. So we can sweep from the last day
backwards in time, applying this rule to fill in missing entries. If we try to
fill in an entry which was not missing, then either nothing happens (if we try
to fill in some number <span class='math'>$n$</span>, and the entry is already <span class='math'>$n$</span>), or we get a
contradiction (if we try to fill in a number <span class='math'>$n$</span>, but the entry contains a
different nonnegative number).
<p>The first entry in the log is a special case, since Farmer John already knows
the cows broke out on that day. So if it is a missing entry, we can set it to
<span class='math'>$0$</span>. If it is any positive number, then we have a contradiction.
<p>If we ever come across a contradiction, then the log is necessarily
inconsistent, so we can just output <span class='math'>$-1$</span>. Otherwise, the log must consist of
several streaks <span class='math'>$0, 1, 2, \dots, k$</span> of various lengths, with possibly some <span class='math'>$-1$</span>s
between streaks - entries which we could not uniquely deduce. We know that the
first streak starts on the first day. 
<p>Suppose there are <span class='math'>$s$</span> streaks and <span class='math'>$t$</span> entries that are still missing. Then to
minimize the number of breakouts, each sequence of consecutive missing entries
would be filled in so that it continues the streak preceding it (e.g.
<span class='math'>$0,1,2,3,-1,-1$</span> would be filled in as <span class='math'>$0,1,2,3,4,5$</span>). So the minimum number of
breakouts is <span class='math'>$s$</span>. 
<p>To maximize the number of breakouts, the cows would have broken out on each of
the <span class='math'>$t$</span> days for which the entry is missing (e.g. <span class='math'>$0,1,2,3,-1,-1$</span> would be
filled in as <span class='math'>$0,1,2,3,0,0$</span>). So the maximum number of breakouts is <span class='math'>$s+t$</span>.
