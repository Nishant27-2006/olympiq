<p>(Analysis by Mark Gordon)</p><p>

This problem is a harder version of the Cow Routing problem that appeared earlier in the bronze contest.  In this problem Bessie may use up to two tickets instead of just a single ticket.</p><p>

One way to solve this problem is to try each intermediate city and use
the same strategy as in the original problem to see which routes can
take us from $A$ to $u$ and which can take us from $u$ to $B$ and take
the cheapest pair of tickets.  However the naive approach takes
$O(CNM)$ time (where $C$ is the number of cities and $M$ is the
maximum length of each route) which is a bit too slow to pass all of
the test cases.</p><p>

To amend this we can simply do most of the work for intermediate city
simultaneously.  We&apos;ll keep an array $\textit{ca2u}$ to represent
the minimum route cost to go from city $A$ to city $u$ and similarly
$\textit{cu2b}$ to give the minimum route cost to go from city $u$ to
city $B$.  If we can successfully calculate these two arrays then the
final answer is just the minimum cost of $\mathit{ca2u}[u] +
\mathit{cu2b}[u]$ over each candidate city $u$.</p><p>

We can calculate this array in $O(NM)$ time by just updating
$\mathit{ca2u}[u]$ for any city $u$ that appears after city $A$ in a
route.  Similarly, we do the same for $\mathit{cu2b}[u]$ for any city
$u$ that appears before city $B$ in a route.  This yields a solution
like below.</p><p>
