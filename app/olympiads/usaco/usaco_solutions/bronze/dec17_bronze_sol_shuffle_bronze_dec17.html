(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>In this problem, we have some cows in a row that shuffle themselves according to
a fixed pattern. We know how they shuffle themselves in one shuffle rotation,
and we know how they&apos;re arranged after three shuffles. We wish to reconstruct
their original ordering.
<p>There are few enough cows that it is possible to guess and check, for each cow
and each possible starting position, if that cow could end up in the location we
currently observe it in. However, there is a way to determine exactly where each
cow was originally without any sort of guesswork.
<p>We can do this by pretending to go backwards in time and construct were each cow
was after two shuffles, then after one shuffle, and then where they were
originally. We know that the cow in position <span class='math'>$i$</span> goes to position <span class='math'>$a_i$</span> after
one shuffle. What this also means though is that if a cow was in position <span class='math'>$a_i$</span>
after one shuffle, then before that shuffle happened, that cow was in position
<span class='math'>$i$</span>!
<p>Therefore, we only have to undo three shuffles to get the original locations of all the cows.

For those who prefer C++, here is Brian Dean's solution:
<pre class='prettyprint'>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
const int MAX_N = 100;
using namespace std;
 
int A[MAX_N+1];
int order[MAX_N+1];
int original_order[MAX_N+1];
 
int main(void)
{
  ifstream fin ("shuffle.in");
  ofstream fout ("shuffle.out");
 
  int N;
  
  fin &gt;&gt; N;
  for (int i=1; i&lt;=N; i++) 
    fin &gt;&gt; A[i];
  for (int i=1; i&lt;=N; i++) 
    fin &gt;&gt; order[i];
 
  for (int iter=0; iter&lt;3; iter++) {    
    for (int i=1; i&lt;=N; i++) original_order[i] = order[A[i]];
    for (int i=1; i&lt;=N; i++) order[i] = original_order[i];
  }
  
  for (int i=1; i&lt;=N; i++)
    fout &lt;&lt; order[i] &lt;&lt; "\n";
  return 0;
}
