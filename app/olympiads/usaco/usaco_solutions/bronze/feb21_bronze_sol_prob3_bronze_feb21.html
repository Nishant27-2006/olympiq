(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi and Brian Dean )
<p>Intuitively, a clockwise fence will &quot;tend&quot; to turn right, and a counterclockwise
fence will tend to turn left. More concretely, for every two adjacent fence
segments, one can compute the angle turned at that corner: either no turn (if
the two segments are in the same direction), or a turn by <span class='math'>$90^{\circ}$</span>
counterclockwise (e.g. if the first segment is E and the second is N), or a turn
by <span class='math'>$-90^{\circ}$</span> counterclockwise (e.g. if the first segment is E and the second
is S). Doing a few examples by hand will reveal that the sum of these
angles, over all corners of the fence, is precisely <span class='math'>$360^{\circ}$</span> if the fence
is counterclockwise, and <span class='math'>$-360^{\circ}$</span> if clockwise (other sums can be achieved
if the fence is allowed to intersect itself, but we don&apos;t have to worry about
this complication in this problem). 
<p>This fact can be proven a variety of ways, such as by inducting on the area of
the region enclosed by the fence. It gives a linear-time algorithm, shown below.
<p>Dhruv&apos;s code:
<p><pre class='prettyprint'>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;cassert&gt;
using namespace std;

int angle_from_direction(char a)
{
	if(a == &apos;E&apos;) return 0;
	if(a == &apos;N&apos;) return 90;
	if(a == &apos;W&apos;) return 180;
	if(a == &apos;S&apos;) return 270;
}

int angle_change(char a,char b)
{
	int theta1 = angle_from_direction(a);
	int theta2 = angle_from_direction(b);
	if(theta2 == (theta1 + 90)%360) return 90;
	else if(theta2 == theta1) return 0;
	else if(theta2 == (theta1 + 270)%360) return -90;
	else assert(false);	//fence should not backtrack on itself
}

void test(string s)
{
	int total_change = 0;
	for(int i=0;i&lt;s.size();i++)
		total_change += angle_change(s[i],s[(i+1)%s.size()]);
	if(total_change == 360) cout &lt;&lt; &quot;CCW\n&quot;;
	else cout &lt;&lt; &quot;CW\n&quot;;
}

int main()
{
	int N;
	string s;
	cin &gt;&gt; N;
	for(int i=0;i&lt;N;i++)
	{
		cin &gt;&gt; s;
		test(s);
	}
}
</pre>
<p>There are several other ways to effectively approach this problem.  For example,
one can look at the direction of any &quot;boundary&quot; segment.  That is, look any
horizontally-oriented segment that is as far north as possible --- if it is 
directed east, the entire path must be clockwise, and if directed west, the 
entire path must be counterclockwise.  In fact, we can draw any horizontal or
vertical line through the scene and deduce from the direction of the segments
along this cross section the overall orientation of the fence.  For example, if
we draw a horizontal line through the scene, it will be cut by some vertical
segments pointing north and some pointing south (in fact, these will alternate 
in direction along the cross section); if the westmost segment points north, the
entire path has a clockwise orientation, and vice versa.
<p>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula'>shoelace formula</a> for
computing areas of polygons also leads to a solution for this problem, since it
delivers a &quot;signed&quot; area, being positive or negative depending on the
orientation of the polygon in question.
