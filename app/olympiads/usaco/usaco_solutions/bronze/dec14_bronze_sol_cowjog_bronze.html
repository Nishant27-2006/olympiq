<p>(Analysis by Jonathan Paulson - <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="751f1a1b14011d141b05140019061a1b351218141c195b161a18">[email&#160;protected]</a>)</p><p>

If a faster cow is behind a slower cow, the faster cow is eventually
going to catch up and join the slower cow&apos;s group (or join a
group in the middle).</p><p>

So we want to count the number of cows who have no slower cows ahead
of them; this is the number of cows who won&apos;t join another group
(and hence will start their own group).</p><p>

The most obvious way to to go through each cow and check if any of the
cows ahead of them are faster. But this is too slow: there are about
$N^2$ pairs of cows, and N = $10^5$. So $N^2$ is about $10^{10}$, and
computers only do about $10^9$ operations per second (which usually
translates to about $10^7$ iterations of a simple loop in one second
of time).</p><p>

Luckily, there is a faster way: start from the back, and keep track of
the slowest cow as you go. This only takes about $N$ operations, which
is very fast.</p><p>

Here is my C++ code for the fast approach:

#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  ll n;
  scanf(&quot;%lld&quot;, &amp;n);
  vector&lt;ll&gt; S;
  for(ll i=0; i&lt;n; i++) {
    ll x, s;
    scanf(&quot;%lld %lld\n&quot;, &amp;x, &amp;s);
    S.push_back(s);
  }

  ll ans = 1;
  ll slow = S[n-1];
  for(ll i=n-2; i&gt;=0; i--) {
    if(S[i] &gt; slow) {
      // cows group up
    } else {
      ans++;
    }
    slow = min(slow, S[i]);
  }
  printf(&quot;%lld\n&quot;, ans);
}
