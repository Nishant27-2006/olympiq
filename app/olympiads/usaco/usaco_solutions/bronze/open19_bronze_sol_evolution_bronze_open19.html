(Analysis by Brian Dean)
<p>This is probably the hardest bronze problem we&apos;ve asked all season, befitting
the fact that it&apos;s on the US Open contest (for which there is a longer time
limit). It takes a good bit of thought to figure out the right solution
structure, after which coding isn&apos;t too bad.  I&apos;ll go through a couple of
solution ideas in detail below.  Hopefully you found this and the other bronze
problems fun and challenging this season!  
<p>First, it may help to think of an instance where we cannot form a proper 
evolutionary tree.  This would be an instance such that no matter how we form
the tree, it would be inevitable that some characteristic would evolve in two
distinct places in the tree.  It turns out that the minimal such bad example
looks like this:
<p><pre>
population1: A 
population2: B 
population3: A B
</pre>
<p>In other words, we have a population with just trait A, a population with just
trait B, and a population with both.  If we want to build a tree out of this 
input, we would need to split on either A or B at the root, but then the
remaining two subtrees would both need to have an edge that adds the other
characteristic. For example, if the root split into &quot;A&quot; and &quot;not A&quot; branches,
then both branches would need to contain an edge that adds the &quot;B&quot; trait.
<p>It will help to actually look at things from the viewpoint of the
characteristics instead of from the viewpoint of the populations, so let&apos;s
&quot;transpose&quot; the input above:
<p><pre>
A: population1 population3 
B: population2 population3
</pre>
<p>The fundamental problem here is that there are populations in A only,
populations in B only, and populations in both A and B.  If we look at the Venn
diagram for  the sets A and B, the picture therefore looks like this:
<p><figure><img src='https://www.usaco.org/current/data/fig2_evolution_bronze_open19.png'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let&apos;s call this situation a &quot;crossing&quot; pair of sets.  In general, two sets  can
be disjoint (no overlap), nesting (one inside the other), or crossing (overlap
but not nesting).  If any two of the characteristics A and B in  our instance
represent crossing sets as above, then we cannot build a proper tree.  On the
other hand, if all the characteristics represent sets that don&apos;t cross (they are
either disjoint or nested), then we get a Venn diagram like this:
<p><figure><img src='https://www.usaco.org/current/data/fig3_evolution_bronze_open19.png'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you look at this picture carefully, hopefully you see a tree formed by the
nesting structure of the sets:
<p><figure><img src='https://www.usaco.org/current/data/fig4_evolution_bronze_open19.png'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>A tree like this is easy to convert into a proper evolutionary tree.  E.g., if
we have three children A, B, and C, we could just make three sequential two-way
splits that add the A, B and C characteristics.
<p>So, at the end of the day, we actually don&apos;t need to build a proper evolutionary
tree, but we just need to test of any of our characteristics represent crossing
sets; if so (and only if so), a proper tree is impossible to build.  This leads 
to probably the easiest solution of the problem, shown in my code below where I
build all the sets of populations having each characteristic and then just test
if any pair of these sets is crossing.
<p>Below this code, I&apos;ll discuss an alternate solution that also solves the problem
and also builds the tree (if possible).

  if (ok) fout &lt;&lt; &quot;yes\n&quot;;
  else fout &lt;&lt; &quot;no\n&quot;;
  return 0;
}

<p>Another solution approach uses slightly different insight: suppose we have two
traits A and B as follows:
<p><pre>
A: (4 populations having trait A)
B: (17 populations having trait B)
</pre>
<p>This means the &quot;+A&quot; edge in the tree (the edge adding trait A) cannot be an
ancestor of the &quot;+B&quot; edge, since otherwise every population with the B trait
would also have the A trait, contradicting the observation that the size of set
A above is smaller than that of B.  In general, this means splits on  traits
involving large sets of populations happen higher in the tree, and in particular
the split at the root has to involve the trait with the largest sized set (the
set having the most populations).  
<p>A method for building the tree therefore is to split on the largest trait,
thereby dividing the populations into two groups, and then continuing to divide
these groups the same way, always splitting on the largest available trait. If
there is ever a tie for the largest trait (say, between traits A and B),  some
careful thought will convince you that either A or B would be suitable for the
split at the root (this is clear if A and B are disjoint, and if  A and B are
crossing we will get into trouble later no matter what; A and B cannot be
nesting if they have the same size).  If we ever end up adding the same trait in
two different places in the tree, we know that building a proper tree was not
possible.
<p>Here&apos;s a cool way to think about the approach above.  Suppose we wanted to sort
a bunch of 3-digit binary numbers.  We could first sort them on their leading
digit, giving a block of numbers starting with 0 followed by a block starting
with 1:
<p><pre>
010
000
011
---
110
100
101
</pre>
<p>Then within each of these two blocks, we can do the same thing, sorting on the
second digit.  This makes our numbers sorted on their first two digits:
<p><pre>
000
---
011
010
---
100
101
---
110
</pre>
<p>Finally, sorting within each block on the last digit makes everything sorted.
<p>If we write our different populations like this:   
<pre>
            traitA traitB traitC traitD traitE... (in decreasing order of size)
population1   1      0      0      1      0 
population2   0      1      1      0      1
population3   1      1      0      0      0
population4   0      1      1      0      1
.
.
.
</pre>
<p>Then each population is expressed as a binary number whose 1s and 0s 
reflect its traits.  Now sorting these binary
numbers the same way as above ends up basically running the tree construction
approach we just described.  We first sort on the leading digit, which separates
the populations having trait A (the largest trait that we wanted to split on at
the root) from those not having trait A.  Then we split those groups on the
second largest trait, and so on.  So building the tree is much like sorting if
we look at it from this perspective.
<p>Note that this problem is directly applicable to real-world problems facing
evolutionary biologists in terms of figuring out the most likely way organisms
evolved in the past.  The tree structure we are building is often called a 
&quot;phylogenetic&quot; tree in this area of study.
