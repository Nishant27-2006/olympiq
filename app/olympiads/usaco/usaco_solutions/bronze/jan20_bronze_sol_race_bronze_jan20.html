(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>Instead of trying to think about the problem in terms of minimizing the amount
of time needed to accomplish a certain distance, we can flip the problem around
- if Bessie can run for <span class='math'>$T$</span> seconds and she wants to be running no more than <span class='math'>$X$</span>
meters per second at the end of the <span class='math'>$T$</span> seconds, what is the furthest distance
she can run?
<p>Intuitively, we want her speed to be as high as possible throughout her run. If
there were no speed cap at the end, Bessie would consistently increase her speed
every second. Because of the presence of the speed cap though, Bessie may need
to switch from speeding up to slowing down in order to meet the requirement of
traveling no more than <span class='math'>$X$</span> meters per second at the end.
<p>As a result, for a given speed <span class='math'>$V$</span>, Bessie will be traveling at that speed for
at most 2 seconds - 1 second when she is speeding up, and one second when she is
slowing down. We can therefore simulate Bessie&apos;s fastest possible run subject to
her starting at 0 meters per second and ending with speed no more than <span class='math'>$X$</span>
meters per second as follows - we will track Bessie&apos;s distance traveled while
she is speeding up and while she is slowing down. We will increment Bessie&apos;s
speed starting at 1 meter per second until she has traveled enough distance to
finish the race. Increment Bessie&apos;s distance covered while speeding up by this
speed, and check if Bessie&apos;s total distance traveled exceeds <span class='math'>$K$</span> meters. If the
distance has not been exceeded, and Bessie could travel at this speed while
slowing down, then increment Bessie&apos;s distance covered while slowing down by
this speed, and perform the total distance check again.
<p>The moment in time when Bessie&apos;s theoretical maximum distance traveled exceeds
<span class='math'>$K$</span> meters is the desired answer. It is worth noting that following this
specific strategy of speeding up and slowing down may not actually meet the race
conditions properly, but it is always possible to construct a strategy that
covers exactly the given distance in the asserted time.
<p>There is one final concern - is simulating this one second at a time fast enough?
The worst possible case here is where Bessie needs to run <span class='math'>$10^9$</span> meters and she
must end the race running at 1 meter per second. In this case, it takes 63245 seconds.
Performing one thousand of these simulations should therefore run in time comfortably.
