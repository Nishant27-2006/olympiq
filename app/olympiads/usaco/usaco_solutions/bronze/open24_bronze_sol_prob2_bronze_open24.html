Let <span class='math'>$L = 1000$</span> be the bound on <span class='math'>$x, y$</span>. We store an <span class='math'>$(L+1)$</span> by <span class='math'>$(L+1)$</span> array, on
which we will record the distance along the fence of each point.
<p>We read the posts in order (ending with the first post again), and as we do, we
traverse every point along the fence, marking each point in the array with
<span class='math'>$0, 1, 2, \dots$</span>. We also record the perimeter <span class='math'>$\ell$</span> (which is the number after
the one we ended on). Since the fence visits each point at most once, the total
time taken for this is <span class='math'>$O(L^2)$</span>.
<p>Now, to compute the answer for each cow, we look up the value of both points in
the array. Then, the distance along the fence in one direction is equal to the
(absolute) difference between these two values; call this distance <span class='math'>$d$</span>. The
distance in the other direction is then just <span class='math'>$\ell - d$</span>, so the answer for this
cow is just <span class='math'>$\min(d, \ell-d)$</span>.
<p>For each cow, the answer takes <span class='math'>$O(1)$</span> time to compute, so the total runtime of
this algorithm is <span class='math'>$O(N+L^2)$</span>.
