(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )
<p>In this problem, we&apos;re given a family tree and asked to identify the
relationship between two cows; call them Bessie and Elsie. We will do this by
finding the common ancestor of Bessie and Elsie (if she exists), and the number
of generations by which each of Bessie and Elsie are removed from the ancestor
cow. Notice that the numbers uniquely define the relationship between Bessie and
Elsie.
<p>But how do we find the two numbers? We can find the mother of a given cow in
<span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> time (also determining whether the mother even exists), by looping over
all relationships. Call this the MOTHER function. Now we can determine whether
one cow is a direct ancestor of another cow in <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> time, by repeatedly
finding the mother of the second cow, and then her mother, and so forth. Let&apos;s
call this the IS-ANCESTOR function. We can also have the IS-ANCESTOR function
return the number of generations by which the first cow is removed from the
second cow.
<p>Now we almost have an algorithm. We can repeatedly check if Bessie is an
ancestor of Elsie, and then if Bessie&apos;s mother is an ancestor of Elsie, and so
forth. By keeping a counter, we can find the minimum number of generations up
the family tree we need to go before Bessie&apos;s ancestor is an ancestor of Elsie.
If no such ancestor satisfies the property, then we can immmediately output &quot;NOT
RELATED.&quot;
<p>Otherwise, let <span class='math'>$b$</span> be the distance of Bessie from the common ancestor, and let
<span class='math'>$a$</span> be the distance of Elsie from the common ancestor (where <span class='math'>$a$</span> is returned by
our IS-ANCESTOR function). All that remains is some casework, but it&apos;s possible
to write less code by putting in a bit more thought. If <span class='math'>$a$</span> and <span class='math'>$b$</span> are both
<span class='math'>$1$</span>, then Bessie and Elsie are &quot;SIBLINGS.&quot; If <span class='math'>$a$</span> and <span class='math'>$b$</span> are both greater than
<span class='math'>$1$</span>, then they are &quot;COUSINS.&quot; Now observe that either <span class='math'>$a &gt; b$</span> or <span class='math'>$b &gt; a$</span>. In the
former case, Bessie is the mother/grandmother/etc. or aunt/great-aunt/etc. of
Elsie. In the latter case, the reverse is true. So if <span class='math'>$a &gt; b$</span>, we can simply
swap the names of Elsie and Bessie, and swap <span class='math'>$a$</span> and <span class='math'>$b$</span>, and we find ourselves
in the <span class='math'>$b &gt; a$</span> case. 
<p>Now we can observe that either <span class='math'>$a = 0$</span> or <span class='math'>$a = 1$</span>. In the former case,
Elsie is the mother/grandmother/etc. of Bessie, whereas in the latter case she
is the aunt/great-aunt/etc. of Bessie. So we simply output the appropriate
number of &quot;great-&quot;s, depending on the value of <span class='math'>$b$</span>, possibly output &quot;grand-&quot;,
depending on <span class='math'>$a$</span> and <span class='math'>$b$</span>, and then output either &quot;mother&quot; or &quot;aunt&quot;, depending
on <span class='math'>$a$</span>.
<p>The overall algorithm is <span class='math'>$O(N^3)$</span>, since we call IS-ANCESTOR at most <span class='math'>$N$</span> times.
Since <span class='math'>$N = 100$</span>, this runs in the time limit, but it is possible to speed up the
algorithm by not recomputing the ancestors of Elsie each time.
