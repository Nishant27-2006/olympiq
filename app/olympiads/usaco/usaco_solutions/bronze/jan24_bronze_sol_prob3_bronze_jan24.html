(Analysis by Rohin Garg)
<p>There are multiple solutions to this problem, each with different thought
processes but the same end result. Two are presented below. An operation of type
<span class='math'>$1$</span> refers to a single walk with pesticide of type <span class='math'>$1$</span>, while an operation of
type <span class='math'>$2$</span> refers to a single walk with pesticide of type <span class='math'>$2$</span>.
<p><strong>Solution 1:</strong> Difference Arrays
<p>Let <span class='math'>$\text{diff}(a)$</span> be the difference array of <span class='math'>$a$</span>. In particular,
<span class='math'>$\text{diff}(a) = [a_1, a_2 - a_1, \ldots, a_n - a_{n-1}]$</span>. Let&apos;s examine how
each type of operation affects <span class='math'>$\text{diff}(a)$</span>.
<p>Assume we do an operation of type 1. The value at indices less than <span class='math'>$h$</span> remain
unchanged, so the corresponding values of <span class='math'>$\text{diff}(a)$</span> stay the same as
well. Because <span class='math'>$a_h$</span> increases by <span class='math'>$1$</span> and <span class='math'>$a_{h-1}$</span> remains unchanged,
<span class='math'>$\text{diff}(a)_h$</span> is the first value that changes, and it increases by <span class='math'>$1$</span>.
Similarly, because <span class='math'>$a_{h+1}$</span> increases by <span class='math'>$2$</span> and <span class='math'>$a_h$</span> increases by <span class='math'>$1$</span>,
<span class='math'>$\text{diff}(a)_{h+1}$</span> increases by <span class='math'>$1$</span>. Extending this argument, an operation
of type <span class='math'>$1$</span> simply increments a suffix of <span class='math'>$\text{diff}(a)$</span>, while and operation
of type <span class='math'>$2$</span> decrements a suffix.
<p>This transformation can be done one more time. Let&apos;s examine how
<span class='math'>$\text{diff}(\text{diff}(a))$</span> changes after each operation. By doing a similar
analysis as before, we can see that the only index that changes is
<span class='math'>$\text{diff}(\text{diff}(a))_h$</span>, and it either increases or decreases by <span class='math'>$1$</span>
depending on the operation type. Finding the minimum operations to make
<span class='math'>$\text{diff}(\text{diff}(a))$</span> all <span class='math'>$0$</span>&apos;s is now straightforward, as it is equal
to <span class='math'>$\sum_{i=1}^n
|\text{diff}(\text{diff}(a))_i|$</span>, because all of the indices
are independent.

#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;

using ll = long long;
 
vector&lt;ll&gt; diff(vector&lt;ll&gt; a) {
    vector&lt;ll&gt; b(a.size());
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; (int) b.size(); i++) {
        b[i] = a[i];
        if (i &gt; 0)
            b[i] -= a[i-1];
    }
    return b;
}

    a = diff(diff(a));
    ll ans = 0;

<p><strong>Solution 2:</strong> Optimized Simulation
<p>The only way to alter the number of bacteria on patch <span class='math'>$1$</span> would be for Farmer
John to use <span class='math'>$h = 1$</span>. This motivates the idea of first calculating the operations
that must be done to make <span class='math'>$a_1 = 0$</span>, then <span class='math'>$a_2 = 0$</span>, and so on.
<p>Note that you&apos;ll never do both types of operations with the same <span class='math'>$h$</span> value, as
they would just undo each other, and doing neither instead of both would get you
the same final configuration in a smaller number of operations. 
<p>This means that we know exactly what set of operations we&apos;ll do with <span class='math'>$h = 1$</span>: If
<span class='math'>$a_i$</span> is positive, we&apos;ll do <span class='math'>$a_i$</span> operations of type <span class='math'>$2$</span>, otherwise we&apos;ll do
<span class='math'>$-a_i$</span> operations of type <span class='math'>$1$</span>. Then, we can ignore <span class='math'>$a_1$</span>, as it can no longer be
changed by any future operation, and continue this process (making sure to
update all array elements when doing an operation). This immediately lends an
<span class='math'>$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$</span> solution, as at each index you have to update
<span class='math'>$\mathcal{O}(n)$</span> other indices. 
<p>What remains is to optimize the simulation of each operation. Let&apos;s start by
considering a simpler version of the problem, where an operation adds <span class='math'>$1$</span> to the
indices after it, instead of <span class='math'>$1, 2, \ldots$</span> In this version, notice that the
value of an index is only changed by the operations that occurred at another
index before it, and all that matters is the difference between the number of
operations of type <span class='math'>$1$</span> and operations of type <span class='math'>$2$</span>. Because of this, instead of
directly updating the values, you can just keep track of the number of
operations that have occurred, and update the value when it is iterated over.
<p>In this version, you can do something similar, except you have to keep track of
two things: the difference between the number of operations of type <span class='math'>$1$</span> and the
number of operations of type <span class='math'>$2$</span>, as well as the total amount the operations
add. As an example, let&apos;s say that there were <span class='math'>$3$</span> more operations of type <span class='math'>$1$</span>
than <span class='math'>$2$</span> at indices <span class='math'>$\leq 5$</span>, and those operations increased the value of <span class='math'>$a_5$</span>
by <span class='math'>$4$</span>. Then, because the contribution of each operation of type <span class='math'>$1$</span> increases
by <span class='math'>$1$</span>, and the contribution of each element of type <span class='math'>$2$</span> decreases by <span class='math'>$1$</span>, the
contribution of all of the operations increases by exactly <span class='math'>$3$</span>. Therefore, the
value of <span class='math'>$a_6$</span> will increase by exactly <span class='math'>$4 + 3 = 7$</span> due to the operations. In
this way, we can calculate the contribution of the operations without having to
directly simulate them, lending us an <span class='math'>$\mathcal{O}(n)$</span> solution.
