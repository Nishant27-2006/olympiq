(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>We start by defining a winning position and a losing position. If the current
player wins given optimal play on both sides, the position is a winning
position, otherwise the position is a losing position.
<p>For positions that are not immediately winning or losing positions, we can make
the following two observations:
<p><ul><li> If one can make a move to a position that is a losing position, then the
current position is a winning position. </li><li> If one can only make moves to
positions that are winning positions, then the current position is a losing
position. </li></ul>
<p>In the context of this problem, the pile having zero stones is a losing
position, the pile having <span class='math'>$1, 2, \dots, 9$</span> stones is a winning position, and the
pile having ten stones is a losing position.
<p><strong>Subtask 1: <span class='math'>$S &lt; 100$</span>.</strong>
<p>We can naively check this process and compute for all <span class='math'>$S$</span> in increasing order if
they are winning positions or losing positions.
<p><pre class='prettyprint'>
T = int(input())
 
def is_pal(j):
	s = str(j)
	return s == &quot;&quot;.join(reversed(s))
 
for _ in range(T):
	S = int(input())
	win = [False] * (S+1)
	for i in range(S+1):
		for j in range(1, i+1):
			if is_pal(j) and not win[i-j]:
				win[i] = True
	print(&quot;B&quot; if win[S] else &quot;E&quot;)
</pre>
<p><strong>Subtask 2: <span class='math'>$S &lt; 10^6$</span>.</strong>
<p>This subtask rewarded people for experimenting with moves and only trying moves
that involved taking at most <span class='math'>$9$</span> stones.
<p><pre class='prettyprint'>
T = int(input())

S = 10**6
win = [False] * (S+1)
for i in range(S+1):
	for j in range(1, min(i+1, 10)):
		if not win[i-j]:
			win[i] = True
 
for _ in range(T):
	S = int(input())
	print(&quot;B&quot; if win[S] else &quot;E&quot;)
</pre>
<p><strong>Subtask 3: <span class='math'>$S &lt; 10^9$</span>.</strong>
<p>If we look at the winning position and losing positions, we can see that a
position is winning if and only if <span class='math'>$S$</span> is not divisible by <span class='math'>$10$</span>. The proof of
this follows directly from observing that taking anywhere from <span class='math'>$1$</span> to <span class='math'>$9$</span> stones
is possible, but it is never possible to remove a multiple of ten. Therefore, we
just naively check if the integer is divisible by <span class='math'>$10$</span>.
<p><strong>Full Credit:</strong>
<p>To check if a very large integer is a multiple of <span class='math'>$10$</span>, it suffices to check if
the last digit of the number is <span class='math'>$0$</span>.
<p>Benjamin Qi&apos;s code:
<pre class='prettyprint'>
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
	start = input()
	print(&apos;E&apos; if start[-1] == &apos;0&apos; else &apos;B&apos;)
</pre>
