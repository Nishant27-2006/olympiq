(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>In this problem, we have two rectangles drawn on a grid and want to draw a
square that covers both of the original rectangles and is as small as possible.
<p>Instead of trying to compute the number directly, let&apos;s reword the question
slightly. Let&apos;s instead ask the similar question: is it possible to draw a
square with side length <span class='math'>$s$</span> that covers both rectangles?
<p>For some values of <span class='math'>$s$</span>, the answer is obviously no. Take the example given in
the problem: we know that the square must stretch from <span class='math'>$x=1$</span> all the way over to
<span class='math'>$x=8$</span>. This means that the side length of the square must be at least <span class='math'>$8-1$</span>, or
<span class='math'>$7$</span>. Similarly, the square must stretch from <span class='math'>$y=6$</span> to <span class='math'>$y=9$</span>, so the side length
of the square must also be at least <span class='math'>$9-6$</span>, or <span class='math'>$3$</span>.
<p>In the example given, the answer happened to be <span class='math'>$7^2$</span>. Is the answer always the
square of the distance that the square is required to stretch?
<p>It turns out the answer to that question is yes. If we look back at that
example, we already know exactly how far the square has to stretch: it must
stretch <span class='math'>$7$</span> units in the <span class='math'>$x$</span>-direction and <span class='math'>$3$</span> units in the <span class='math'>$y$</span>-direction. That
means that if we make the square <span class='math'>$7$</span> units long and place it directly inside the
column from <span class='math'>$x=1$</span> to <span class='math'>$x=8$</span>, we can slide  it until it covers the desired
horizontal region from <span class='math'>$y=6$</span> and <span class='math'>$y=9$</span>.
<p>Therefore, what we need to do is compute the distance the square must stretch in
both the <span class='math'>$x$</span>-direction and the <span class='math'>$y$</span>-direction, take the maximum of those, and
print out the square of that result.
<p>Here is my Java code:
<pre class='prettyprint'>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
public class square {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		// initialize file I/O
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;square.in&quot;));
		PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;square.out&quot;)));

		// track the bottom, top, left, and rightmost points that need to be covered 
		int smallestX = 10;
		int largestX = 0;
		int smallestY = 10;
		int largestY = 0;

		// read in two lines, store corners of the pastures
		for(int i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) {
			StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
			int xLow = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
			int yLow = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
			int xHigh = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
			int yHigh = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
			
			if(xLow &lt; smallestX) {
				smallestX = xLow;
			}
			if(xHigh &gt; largestX) {
				largestX = xHigh;
			}
			if(yLow &lt; smallestY) {
				smallestY = yLow;
			}
			if(yHigh &gt; largestY) {
				largestY = yHigh;
			}
		}
		
		// compute the desired side length of the square
		int desiredSideLength = largestX - smallestX;
		if(largestY - smallestY &gt; largestX - smallestX) {
			desiredSideLength = largestY - smallestY; 
		}
		
		// print the answer
		pw.println(desiredSideLength * desiredSideLength);
		pw.close();
	}
}
