(Analysis by Suhas Nagar)
<p>The number of days <span class='math'>$D$</span> is uncertain, but if we knew the number of days that have
passed from  the initial configuration, solving the problem would be easier,
since we can think of each initially infected cow as a window of <span class='math'>$2D+1$</span> ones
(since the infection spreads D units to the left and right of the originally
infected cow) and we want to cover the infected cows in the input with the
minimal amount of these windows. 
<p>We first notice that our windows can overlap. Suppose we wanted to cover 8 cows
with windows of size 5. It is fine to use two windows and have a two cow
overlap, because an already infected cow cannot get reinfected. 
<p>This leads us to see that if there are multiple values of <span class='math'>$D$</span> that allow for an
end state to be feasible, the maximal value of <span class='math'>$D$</span> will always correspond to the
minimum  number of initial cows, since we want to prioritize each window
covering the most amount of cows.
<p>Seemingly, the maximum window that we can use would be the minimum contiguous
region of <span class='math'>$1$</span>s in the  input, as if the window we pick was any larger, that
region would be impossible to cover.  However, there are two special cases. 
<p>Case 1 (End Pieces): If there is a group of <span class='math'>$I$</span> infected cows on either end of
our list,  it is possible for the initial infected cow to have been the one on
the very edge, in which  case our maximum window could be up to <span class='math'>$2*I-1$</span> instead
of just
<span class='math'>$I$</span>
<p>Case 2 (Even Pieces): If there is a group of <span class='math'>$I$</span> infected cows where <span class='math'>$I$</span> is
even, it is  impossible for this to have been covered by a single cow. Instead,
we must have had at least  two cows, so the maximum window in this case is <span class='math'>$I-1$</span>
instead of <span class='math'>$I$</span>.
<p>Now, we can calculate the maximum value of <span class='math'>$D$</span> possible by taking the minimum
windows across  the end, even, and odd cases and then summing the ceiling of
<span class='math'>$\frac{I}{D}$</span> for every contiguous  group of <span class='math'>$I$</span> infected cows.

<p>Alternatively, we could have simulated all possible values of &quot;windows&quot; from <span class='math'>$1$</span>
to <span class='math'>$N$</span>,  breaking when we find the first invalid window, and take the minimum
across all possible  values. We can break early since if we are unable to cover
our input with some window, we  cannot use a larger window to cover it. The time
complexity here is <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span>. Let the number  of regions of contiguous <span class='math'>$1$</span>s be <span class='math'>$R$</span>.
We iterate <span class='math'>$R$</span> times for every window, and the maximum  window we check is
bounded by <span class='math'>$\frac{N}{R}$</span> so we have <span class='math'>$O(R*\frac{N}{R}) = O(N)$</span>
