(Analysis by Brian Dean)
<p>This is a nice problem where the coding is straightforward once you have 
figured out the right structure to search for as an answer.
<p>The abstract structure we are dealing with here is a tree --- a set of <span class='math'>$n$</span> nodes
connected by <span class='math'>$n-1$</span> edges, where every node is reachable from  every other node
and there is no cycle.  Trees are everywhere in computer science and you can
expect to see them often in higher divisions.
<p>Let&apos;s call a node with only incoming directed edges a &quot;sink&quot;, since  things can
flow into it but not out.  The short answer to the problem is that we need to
see if our tree has a single unique sink, in which case this is the answer. 
Let&apos;s see if we can argue this:
<p>1. If all nodes in the tree can reach node <span class='math'>$x$</span>, then we claim node <span class='math'>$x$</span> must be
the unique sink.  All nodes aside from <span class='math'>$x$</span> need at least one outgoing directed
edge to be able to escape from them, so they aren&apos;t sinks.  Further, node <span class='math'>$x$</span>
cannot have any outgoing edges, since if there was an edge  <span class='math'>$x \rightarrow y$</span>
then <span class='math'>$y$</span> couldn&apos;t reach <span class='math'>$x$</span>.
<p>2. If <span class='math'>$x$</span> is the unique sink, then all nodes in the tree can reach <span class='math'>$x$</span>.  Suppose
some node <span class='math'>$y$</span> cannot reach <span class='math'>$x$</span>.  We know <span class='math'>$y$</span> has an outgoing edge since it isn&apos;t
a sink, so let&apos;s follow such an edge.   This lands us on another node (say, <span class='math'>$z$</span>)
which if not a sink must also have an outgoing edge, so let&apos;s  follow such an
edge.  If we keep following outgoing edges until we no longer can, we inevitably
must get stuck at a sink, since this is the only node with no outgoing edges
(and we can&apos;t go around in cycles since a tree has no cycles).  This means we
have reached <span class='math'>$x$</span>, since <span class='math'>$x$</span> is the only sink.
<p>My code for solving this problem is below.
<p><pre class='prettyprint'>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
using namespace std;
 
int N, incoming[101], outgoing[101];
 
int main(void)
{
  ifstream fin (&quot;factory.in&quot;);
  fin &gt;&gt; N;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;N-1; i++) {
    int a, b;
    fin &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b;
    outgoing[a]++;
    incoming[b]++; 
  }
 
  ofstream fout (&quot;factory.out&quot;);
  int answer = -1;
  for (int i=1; i&lt;=N; i++) {
    if (outgoing[i]==0 &amp;&amp; answer != -1 ) { answer = -1; break; } // found two sinks -- bad!
    if (outgoing[i]==0) answer = i;  // found first sink; remember it
  }
  fout &lt;&lt; answer &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
  return 0;
}
