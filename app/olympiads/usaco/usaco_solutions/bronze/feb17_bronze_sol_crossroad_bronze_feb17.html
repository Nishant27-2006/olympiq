(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>In this problem, we have a series of observations about cows crossing a road and
we want to count the number of times that we have confirmed that a cow has
crossed the road.
<p>Imagine that we only have one cow, and we have the list of observations for that
cow. The only time when we can confirm that a cow has crossed the road is when
some observation has the cow on one side of the road, and the observation
immediately following that one has the cow on the other side of the road.
<p>In the actual problem, we have 10 different cows. Since different cows are
independent of each other, we can track their last known locations independently
and then accumulate the total number of times we have confirmed that a cow has
had a crossing.
