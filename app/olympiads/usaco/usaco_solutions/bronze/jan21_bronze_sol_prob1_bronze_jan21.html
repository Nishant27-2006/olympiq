(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>The minimum number of times Bessie must have hummed the cowphabet for a string of
length <span class='math'>$N$</span> is at most <span class='math'>$N$</span> - we can just map the <span class='math'>$i$</span>th letter that Farmer John
heard to the <span class='math'>$i$</span>th iteration that Bessie hummed.
<p>Because of this, we can naively try to see if it is possible to hum the cowphabet
once to get Bessie&apos;s hummed string. If not, then we see if it&apos;s possible if
Bessie hummed it twice, then three times, and so on.
<p>How do we validate that it is possible to hum the cowphabet <span class='math'>$K$</span> times to get the
string that Farmer John heard? Consider the very first character that Bessie
hummed. Does it match the first character that Farmer John heard? If not, then
Farmer John must have ignored it, and we can discard this character.
<p>What happens if the two characters match? It seems that we have a choice to
make, whether Farmer John might have missed this character in favor of a later
one, or if Farmer John actually heard this character. We claim that if Farmer
John could have heard the string that Bessie hummed, then it must be possible
for Farmer John to have heard this specific character. If Farmer John could have
heard the string without using this specific character, then the first character
that Farmer John heard must have come strictly later. However, if that is the
case, then we can safely replace that character with this one.
<p>Therefore, if two characters match, we can assert that Farmer John heard it, and
then advance the character that Farmer John expects to hear to the next
character.
<p>Some people may recognize this problem as the classical problem of determining
if one string is a subsequence of another string.

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
 
int main() {
  std::string alphabet, s;
  std::cin &gt;&gt; alphabet &gt;&gt; s;
  std::string hummed = &quot;&quot;;
  for(int numHums = 1; true; numHums++) {
    hummed += alphabet;
    int idx = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; hummed.size() &amp;&amp; idx &lt; s.size(); i++) {
      if(hummed[i] == s[idx]) {
        idx++;
      }
    }
    if(idx == s.size()) {
      std::cout &lt;&lt; numHums &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
      return 0;
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Can we do better than trying to brute force for the answer?
<p>If we consider two adjacent letters that Bessie hums, they can only be in the
same iteration of the cowphabet if the latter character comes after the former
character in the cowphabet. This lets us come up with a very short solution -
notably, we can count the number of times a letter is not after the letter that
immediately was heard before it in the cowphabet, and then the answer is just one
larger than the number of times this inversion is observed.
