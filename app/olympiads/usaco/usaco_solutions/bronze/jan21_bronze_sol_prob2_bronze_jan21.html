(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>In the best case, each cow is in its own group, and the answer is <span class='math'>$N$</span>. When is
this allowed to happen?
<p>Let <span class='math'>$O$</span> be the number of odd cows and <span class='math'>$E$</span> be the number of even cows initially
in the list. For each cow to be in its own group, either <span class='math'>$E = O$</span> or <span class='math'>$E = O+1$</span>.
<p>If this is not the case, then we must have groups with more than one cow. There
are two cases. 
<p>If <span class='math'>$E &gt; O+1$</span>, then the problem is that we have too many even cows. However, note
that two even numbers added together is an even number. Therefore, we can do the
assignment as follows - take one even cow, then one odd cow, and repeat this <span class='math'>$O$</span>
times. The remaining cows are all even, and we can put them all in the same
group. In this case, the answer is <span class='math'>$2O+1$</span>.
<p>The other case is when <span class='math'>$E &lt; O$</span>, so we have too many odd cows. Note that two odd
numbers added together is an even number. To deal with having too many odd cows,
we have to take two odd cows and pair them, which is equivalent to having two
fewer odd cows and one more even cow. We can repeat this process of pairing two
odd cows until <span class='math'>$E \ge O$</span>, and then we can use the above logic to compute the
answer.
<p>Here is Brian Dean&apos;s code.

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
 
int main(void)
{
  int O=0, E=0, N, x;
  cin &gt;&gt; N;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;N; i++) {
    cin &gt;&gt; x;
    if (x % 2 == 0) E++; else O++;
  }
  while (O &gt; E) { O=O-2; E++; }
  if (E &gt; O+1) E = O+1;
  cout &lt;&lt; E + O &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
}
