(Analysis by Jonathan Paulson and Brian Dean)
<p>We should assume that <span class='math'>$R$</span> is as large as possible so as to minimize the number
of initial infections required. The largest <span class='math'>$R$</span> could be is one less than the
smallest gap between a healthy cow and an infected cow (if <span class='math'>$R$</span> were any larger,
the healthy cow would&apos;ve been infected). Assume this is the true value of <span class='math'>$R$</span>.
(If there are no healthy cows, assume <span class='math'>$R=\infty$</span>). By considering all pairs of
cows, we can find <span class='math'>$R$</span> in <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> time.  Alternatively, as in the code below,
we can mark the locations of all cows and look at all the gaps between adjacent
cows, with one being health and the other sick (another similar approach would
involve sorting the cows by position first, then looking at the same gaps).
<p>Having determined <span class='math'>$R$</span>, we next need to figure out the number of initially sick
cows.  Any block of sick cows within which neighboring cows are at most <span class='math'>$R$</span> apart
could have arisen from just a single sick cow.  Hence, we count the number of
&quot;blocks&quot; of sick cows (contiguous groups of sick cows delineated by a healthy cow)
and then break up these blocks whenever we find a pair of adjacent sick cows within
a block at distance <span class='math'>$R$</span> or larger.  This leaves groups of cows that could have each
been infected from a single initial cow.
<p>Here is Brian Dean&apos;s solution:
<pre class='prettyprint'>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
using namespace std;
 
int N, A[1000001]; // 1=healthy, -1=sick, 0=no cow
 
// Returns size of largest gap between a health and a sick cow
int find_smallest_01_gap(void)
{
  int smallest_gap = 2000000, current_start = -1;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;=1000000; i++) 
    if (A[i] != 0) {
      if (current_start!=-1 &amp;&amp; A[current_start]!=A[i] &amp;&amp; i-current_start&lt;smallest_gap) 
	smallest_gap = i-current_start;
      current_start = i;
    }
  return smallest_gap;
}
 
// Number of blocks of sick cows, delineated by healthy cows
int num_sick_clusters(void)
{
  int last_state = 0, answer = 0;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;=1000000; i++) 
    if (A[i] != 0) {
      if (A[i] != last_state &amp;&amp; A[i] == 1) answer++;
      last_state = A[i];
    }
  return answer;
}
 
// Number of gaps of size r or larger within blocks of sick cows
int num_sick_gaps(int r)
{
  int answer = 0, current_start = 0;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;=1000000; i++) 
    if (A[i] != 0) {
      if (current_start!=0 &amp;&amp; A[current_start]==1 &amp;&amp; A[i]==1 &amp;&amp; i-current_start&gt;=r) 
	answer++;
      current_start = i;
    }
  return answer;
}
 
int main(void)
{
  ifstream fin (&quot;socdist2.in&quot;);
  int x, s;
  fin &gt;&gt; N;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;N; i++) {
    fin &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; s;
    if (s==1) { A[x] = 1; }
    if (s==0) { A[x] = -1; }
  }
  ofstream fout (&quot;socdist2.out&quot;);
  int r = find_smallest_01_gap();
  fout &lt;&lt; num_sick_clusters() + num_sick_gaps(r) &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
  return 0;
}
