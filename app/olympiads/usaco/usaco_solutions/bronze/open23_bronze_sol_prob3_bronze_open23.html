(Analysis by Richard Qi)
<p>For <span class='math'>$N \le 1000, T \le 10000$</span>, we can directly simulate the process described by
the problem. Initialize an array corresponding to the current order of the cows
(<span class='math'>$0$</span> to <span class='math'>$N-1$</span>). Call this array &quot;order&quot;. 
<p>For each timestep, first update &quot;order&quot; by shifting according to the indices
listed in <span class='math'>$A$</span> (you can create a copy of &quot;order&quot; and change the values in the
copy, or swap/change the values in place). Then, update <span class='math'>$A$</span> by adding one to
each element and taking modulo <span class='math'>$N$</span>. 
<p>Richard&apos;s code (C++):
<pre class='prettyprint'>
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
using namespace std;
 
const int mx = 200005;
int A[mx];
int ans[mx];
 
int main(){
    cin.tie(0)-&gt;sync_with_stdio(0);
    int N, K, T; cin &gt;&gt; N &gt;&gt; K &gt;&gt; T;

        cin &gt;&gt; A[i];
    }
 
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++){
        ans[i] = i;
    }

        //active positions rotate

        for(int i = 1; i &lt;= K; i++){
            vals.push_back(ans[A[i]]);
        }
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; K; i++){
            ans[A[i+1]] = vals[(i-1+(vals.size())) % (vals.size())];

<p>Try looking at the above output; notice any patterns? There are two similar
solutions that naturally follow from patterns that can be found in the above
output. The solution code for each solution is at the bottom of the page.
<p><strong> Solution 1: </strong>  Look at a single cow&apos;s journey over time. For example,
look at cow <span class='math'>$0$</span>. Cow <span class='math'>$0$</span> started at position <span class='math'>$0$</span> at <span class='math'>$T = 0$</span>, then was at
position <span class='math'>$3$</span> during <span class='math'>$1 \le T \le 3$</span>, then was at position <span class='math'>$6$</span> during
<span class='math'>$4 \le T \le 6$</span>. Other than <span class='math'>$T=0$</span>, cow <span class='math'>$0$</span> appears to stay at a position for
exactly <span class='math'>$3$</span> minutes, then move <span class='math'>$3$</span> positions forward, then stay at that position
for exactly <span class='math'>$3$</span> minutes, etc.
<p>This is no coincidence: cow <span class='math'>$1$</span> follows the same behavior! Cow <span class='math'>$1$</span> starts at
position <span class='math'>$1$</span> for <span class='math'>$0 \le T \le 1$</span>, then goes to position <span class='math'>$4$</span> for <span class='math'>$2 \le T \le 4$</span>,
then goes to position <span class='math'>$7$</span> for <span class='math'>$5 \le T \le 7$</span>. In fact, if you examine further,
cow <span class='math'>$2$</span> also exhibits this behavior, moving <span class='math'>$3$</span> positions forward every <span class='math'>$3$</span>
minutes. Cow <span class='math'>$3$</span> moves <span class='math'>$4$</span> positions forward every <span class='math'>$4$</span> minutes, which is
slightly different from cows <span class='math'>$0-2$</span>, but still follows the pattern of moving <span class='math'>$i$</span>
positions every <span class='math'>$i$</span> minutes. 
<p>A natural question to ask is &quot;why is this happening?&quot;. We will prove why this is
happening for cow <span class='math'>$2$</span>. Because <span class='math'>$A_1 = 0$</span> and <span class='math'>$A_2 = 3$</span>, cow <span class='math'>$2$</span> is &quot;between&quot;
these two active positions and does not move until <span class='math'>$T = 2$</span>, when
<span class='math'>$A_1 = 2, A_2 = 5$</span>. During this timestep, cow <span class='math'>$2$</span> moves to position <span class='math'>$5$</span>. So,
after this timestep, cow <span class='math'>$2$</span> is at position <span class='math'>$5$</span>, <span class='math'>$A_1 = 3, A_2 = 6$</span>. Notice that
at the very beginning of timestep <span class='math'>$T=3$</span>, cow <span class='math'>$2$</span> is still between the active
positions <span class='math'>$A_1$</span> and <span class='math'>$A_2$</span>. In fact, cow <span class='math'>$2$</span> is exactly two positions after <span class='math'>$A_1$</span>
and <span class='math'>$1$</span> position before <span class='math'>$A_2$</span>, which was true at <span class='math'>$T=0$</span> as well.
<p>This motivates looking at cow <span class='math'>$2$</span> in the following way: observe cow <span class='math'>$2$</span> relative
to active positions <span class='math'>$A_1$</span> and <span class='math'>$A_2$</span>. Cow <span class='math'>$2$</span> is always between <span class='math'>$A_1$</span> and <span class='math'>$A_2$</span>,
because cow <span class='math'>$2$</span> stays in place while <span class='math'>$A_1$</span> and <span class='math'>$A_2$</span> increase at a rate of <span class='math'>$1$</span>
unit per second, and as soon as <span class='math'>$A_1$</span> is equal to the position of cow <span class='math'>$1$</span>, cow
<span class='math'>$1$</span> jumps ahead <span class='math'>$A_2-A_1$</span> positions and is now just behind position <span class='math'>$A_2$</span>. This
also shows why cow <span class='math'>$j$</span> jumps exactly <span class='math'>$A_{i+1}-A_i$</span> positions every <span class='math'>$A_{i+1}-A_i$</span>
timesteps (if <span class='math'>$A_i \le j &lt; A_{i+1}$</span>).
<p>We use the above observation to solve the problem in the following way: first,
define <span class='math'>$A_{K+1} = N$</span> for convenience. Then, for each <span class='math'>$i$</span> from <span class='math'>$i=1$</span> to <span class='math'>$i=K$</span>,
consider all cows <span class='math'>$j$</span> in the range <span class='math'>$A_i \le j &lt; A_{i+1}$</span>.
<p>Cow <span class='math'>$j$</span> first stays in place for <span class='math'>$j-A_i$</span> minutes, during which <span class='math'>$A_i$</span> increases
to meet <span class='math'>$j$</span>. Then, on the <span class='math'>$j-A_i+1$</span>th minute, <span class='math'>$j$</span> jumps forward <span class='math'>$A_{i+1}-A_i$</span>
positions.
<p>After this point, there are <span class='math'>$T&apos; = T-(j-A_i+1)$</span> minutes left to go. From then on,
every <span class='math'>$A_{i+1}-A_i$</span> minutes, cow <span class='math'>$j$</span>&apos;s position increases by <span class='math'>$A_{i+1}-A_i$</span>. So,
during this phase, cow <span class='math'>$j$</span>&apos;s position increases
<span class='math'>$\lfloor \frac{T&apos;}{A_{i+1}-A_i} \rfloor$</span> times, and each time, cow <span class='math'>$j$</span>&apos;s
position increases by <span class='math'>$A_{i+1}-A_i$</span> positions, for a total position increase of
<span class='math'>$\lfloor \frac{T&apos;}{A_{i+1}-A_i} \rfloor \cdot (A_{i+1}-A_i)$</span>.
<p>We can compute this quantity in <span class='math'>$\mathcal O \left(1 \right)$</span> time for every
position <span class='math'>$j$</span>, for a total time complexity of <span class='math'>$\mathcal O \left(N \right)$</span>.
<p><strong> Solution 2: </strong> Instead of having the active positions shift by <span class='math'>$+1$</span>, which
hard to think about, suppose that instead all cows shift by <span class='math'>$-1$</span>, while the
active positions remain constant throughout the entire process. In this way, the
relative positions between the active indices and the cows remain exactly the
same. So, if we simulate the process of shifting cows back by <span class='math'>$-1$</span> and keeping
<span class='math'>$A$</span> constant, we will end up with the same final array as the original process
(shifted by <span class='math'>$T$</span>). 
<p>Here&apos;s the output of this shifted order; the pattern is easier to spot now.

<p>The pattern is the following: for every <span class='math'>$i$</span>, the values in the range
<span class='math'>$A_i \le j &lt; A_{i+1}$</span> always stay in the positions which are in the range
<span class='math'>$A_i \le j &lt; A_{i+1}$</span>. If we consider these values, the values cyclically shift
left by <span class='math'>$1$</span> every minute.
<p>For example, look at the indices <span class='math'>$3, 4, 5, 6$</span> in the above output.  The values
at those indices start as <span class='math'>$3, 4, 5, 6$</span> at <span class='math'>$T = 0$</span>, then <span class='math'>$4, 5, 6, 3$</span> at <span class='math'>$T=1$</span>,
then <span class='math'>$5, 6, 3, 4$</span> at <span class='math'>$T=2$</span>, then <span class='math'>$6, 3, 4, 5$</span> at <span class='math'>$T=3$</span>, then <span class='math'>$3, 4, 5, 6$</span> at
<span class='math'>$T=4$</span> (and keeps repeating in this cycle forever).
<p>So, for each <span class='math'>$j$</span> such that <span class='math'>$A_i \le j &lt; A_{i+1}$</span>, we cyclically shift it to the
left <span class='math'>$T$</span> times modulo <span class='math'>$A_{i+1}-A_i$</span> within the subarray with left endpoint <span class='math'>$A_i$</span>
and right endpoint <span class='math'>$A_{i+1}-1$</span>. Finally, at the end, we add back <span class='math'>$T$</span> to the
final position to get back the original indices.
