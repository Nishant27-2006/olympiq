(Analysis by Brian Dean)
<p>This is a nice example of a problem where half the work goes into figuring out
useful structural properties of the solution, and then the other half goes into
writing code to search for a solution based on this knowledge.  In this case,
let <span class='math'>$M$</span> be the maximum number of characteristics any two cows have in common,
over all pairs of cows.  We claim that <span class='math'>$M+1$</span> is the answer.
<p>Here is a simple argument.  If we pick two cows (say <span class='math'>$A$</span> and <span class='math'>$B$</span>) that have <span class='math'>$M$</span>
traits in common, then we can ask about just those traits, generating <span class='math'>$M$</span> &quot;yes&quot;
answers and leaving a feasible set that still contains <span class='math'>$A$</span> and <span class='math'>$B$</span>.  Hence, the
maximum number of &quot;yes&quot; answers in a transcript could be larger than <span class='math'>$M$</span>. On the
other hand, the number of &quot;yes&quot; answers in any transcript cannot be larger than
<span class='math'>$M+1$</span>.  Suppose we have a transcript involving <span class='math'>$M+1$</span> yes answers after which
there are still multiple cows in our feasible set.  If so, those cows must have
had more than <span class='math'>$M$</span> traits in common, which cannot be the case!  After <span class='math'>$M+1$</span> &quot;yes&quot;
answers, we therefore must have reduced the feasible set down to at most a
single cow.
<p>Now that we know all we need to do is compute <span class='math'>$M$</span>, the coding part isn&apos;t too
bad. My code below does this in perhaps the most straightforward way, looping
over all pairs of cows and for each, checking the number of characteristics in
common again with two &quot;for&quot; loops.  The input size is small enough that this
runs fast enough to pass all test cases.  
<p>As a note to those en route to silver, however, one could make the &quot;num_common&quot;
function quite a bit faster using fancier data structures like a binary search
tree (e.g., a &quot;set&quot; in C++) or a hash table (e.g., an &quot;unordered_set&quot; in C++). 
To compare cows <span class='math'>$A$</span> and <span class='math'>$B$</span>, we would add all of <span class='math'>$A$</span>&apos;s characteristics to the
data structure, then do lookups for all of <span class='math'>$B$</span>&apos;s characteristics, counting the
number that succeed.  Alternatively, we could have sorted every cow&apos;s list of
characteristics, and to compare <span class='math'>$A$</span> with <span class='math'>$B$</span> we enact the process of &quot;merging&quot;
their sorted characteristics into one larger sorted list, a standard algorithmic
procedure (e.g., part of the &quot;merge sort&quot; algorithm) that allows us to easily 
count duplicates along the way.  Alternatively still, after sorting, we could
run through all of <span class='math'>$B$</span>&apos;s characteristics and binary search for them in <span class='math'>$A$</span>&apos;s
sorted list of characteristics.
