(Analysis by Nick Wu)

The most direct solution involves taking each photo and then checking every 
flower in that photo for an average flower.

There are

$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

photos, and checking each flower in the photo takes

$\mathcal{O}(N)$

, so this solution runs in

$\mathcal{O}(N^3)$

time.

Code is as follows.

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out)));
    int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
    int[] petals = new int[n];
    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      petals[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
    }
    int photos = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for(int j = i; j < n; j++) {
        int totalPetals = 0;
        for(int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
          totalPetals += petals[k];
        }
        boolean present = false;
        for(int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
          if(petals[k] * (j-i+1) == totalPetals) {
            present = true;
          }
        }
        if(present) {
          photos++;
        }
      }
    }
    pw.println(photos);
    pw.close();
  }
}

It's possible (but not necessary) to optimize this down to

$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

.
One observation we can make is that all photos with more than one flower 
consist of taking a smaller photo and then including the next rightmost flower.

Let us consider processing all photos that use flower

$i$

as the leftmost
flower, starting by using the photo that contains only flower

$i$

and then
adding flowers one by one to the right. We can maintain a collection of all the
flowers we have seen so far. As we do this, we also need to keep track of the
total sum of petals we have seen so far so we know what the average petal count
is, and then we can check whether we have seen that petal count before. Because
the number of petals is bounded above by

$10^3$

, we can use a boolean array to
track which petal counts we have seen. Alternatively, we can use a set.
