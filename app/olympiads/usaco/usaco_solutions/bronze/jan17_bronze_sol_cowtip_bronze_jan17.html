(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>In this problem, we have a rectangles of zeroes and ones. A &quot;toggle&quot; of a
subrectangle consists of taking every 0 in the rectangle and turning it into a
1, and taking every 1 in the rectangle and turning it into a 0. We want to
toggle as few subrectangles as possible to turn every number in the rectangle to
zero.
<p>If we look at the various squares in the grid, we see that the ones closer to
the top-left corner can be toggled by more subrectangles, whereas the ones
closer to the bottom-right corner can be toggled by fewer subrectangles. In
particular, we note that the bottom-right corner can only be toggled by one
subrectangle - the entire rectangle. Whether we need to toggle the entire
rectangle then is entirely determined by whether the bottom-right corner needs
to be toggled.
<p>After we decide whether to toggle that one, we can now consider the square that
is directly to the left of the bottom-right corner. That square can now only be
toggled by one rectangle, and the decision there is uniquely determined as well.
We can then consider every square in the bottom row from right-to-left and
toggle the subrectangle when that square needs to be toggled.
<p>After inspecting every square in the bottom row, it is guaranteed that the bottom row is
entirely zeroes.
Thus, one can treat the rectangle as if it had one fewer row, and we can repeat
the above process again. We do this repeatedly until the entire rectangle is correctly
formatted.
