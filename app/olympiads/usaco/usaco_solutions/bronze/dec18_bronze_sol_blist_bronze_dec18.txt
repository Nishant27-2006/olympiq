The key to this problem is realizing that the IDs of the buckets aren't relevant
to solving it. Every bucket is interchangeable with every bucket, because the
only thing we want to know is the maximum number of buckets that will be in use
at some time.

One straightforward way to figure this out is to simply iterate over all
possible times, from

$1$

to

$1,000$

, and check for each interval whether it
contains that time. This will be around

$1,000 * 100$

operations, which is fast
enough to get full credit.

Here's a solution implementing this method:

#include <algorithm>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
 
int N;
int S[101], T[101], B[101];
 
int main(void) {
  ifstream fin ("blist.in");
  fin >> N;
  for (int i=1; i<=N; i++) {
    fin >> S[i] >> T[i] >> B[i];
  }

  int max_buckets = 0;
  for (int time=1; time<=1000; time++) {
    int buckets_at_this_time = 0;
    for (int i=1; i<=N; i++) {
      if (S[i] <= time && time <= T[i]) {
        buckets_at_this_time += B[i];
      }
    }
    max_buckets = max(max_buckets, buckets_at_this_time);
  }
  
  ofstream fout ("blist.out");
  fout << max_buckets << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}

Note that this will end up being a lot of unnecessary
work -- two times right next to each other will almost always have the same
number of buckets needed, so it would be nice to not repeat all that work.  If the 
limits for this problem were higher (e.g., for a "silver" level version of the
problem), we would need to use a more sophisticated approach.  Luckily, we can do better: we can simulate each "event" (either the start of
stop of a milking) in the order that they occurred. We start by adding the
points

$s_i$

and

$t_i$

to a big array for each interval

$i$

. Then, we sort the
array, and consider the points in increasing order. We keep track of the number
of buckets currently being used, starting with zero. For each point, we check
whether it's a start or end point: if it's a start point

$s_i$

, we add

$b_i$

to
the number of buckets in use, and if it's an end point

$t_i$

, we subtract

$b_i$

.
(This technique is called a "sweep", because if you think of all the points on a
horizontal number line, we are "sweeping" across the line, processing each point
that we come across.)

We process each start point and each end point exactly once, so we will end up
having around

$2 * N = 200$

operations in total, a substantial improvement over
the more straightforward method. More generally, the runtime of this algorithm
is

$O(N \log N)$

(the log comes from our needing to sort the array), while the
runtime of the previous algorithm is

$O(N * T)$

(where

$T$

is the maximum
possible time).

Here is Brian's code, implementing this second method. Note that he does not sort
the array, and instead puts the start and end points directly into an array of
size

$1,000$

. This gives him a runtime of

$O(N + T)$

rather than

$O(N \log N)$

, but the basic idea is the same.

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;
 
int N;
int S[101], T[101], B[101];
int start[1001], finish[1001];
 
int solve(void)
{
  int buckets_needed = 0, b = 0;
  for (int t=1; t<=1000; t++) {
    if (start[t]) b += B[start[t]];
    buckets_needed = max(buckets_needed, b);
    if (finish[t]) b -= B[finish[t]];
  }
  return buckets_needed;
}
 
int main(void)
{
  ifstream fin ("blist.in");
  fin >> N;
  for (int i=1; i<=N; i++) {
    fin >> S[i] >> T[i] >> B[i];
    start[S[i]] = i;
    finish[T[i]] = i;
  }
  
  ofstream fout ("blist.out");
  fout << solve() << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
