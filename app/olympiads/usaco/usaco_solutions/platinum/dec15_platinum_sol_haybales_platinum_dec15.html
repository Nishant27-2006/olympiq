(Analysis by Nick Wu)
<p>For this problem, we are given a list of <span class='math'>$N$</span> integers and want to support the
following three operations:
<p>1) Compute the minimum number in an interval over the list.
<p>2) Compute the sum of all numbers in an interval over the list.
<p>3) Increase every number in an interval of the list by some number <span class='math'>$K$</span>.
<p>We start by describing a data structure which will support the first two
operations in <span class='math'>$O(\log N)$</span> time.
<p>Given the initial list, we will maintain, for a specific set of intervals, the
minimum number in that interval as well as the sum of all numbers in that
interval. The list of intervals that we use will be as follows:
<p><ul><li><span class='math'>$[1, N]$</span> is in the set.</li><li>If <span class='math'>$[a, b]$</span> is in the set with <span class='math'>$a &lt; b$</span>, then letting
<span class='math'>$c = \lfloor \frac{a+b}{2} \rfloor$</span>, <span class='math'>$[a,
c]$</span> and <span class='math'>$[c+1, b]$</span> are in the set.
</li></ul>
<p>Note that there are <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> intervals in this set. Furthermore, for convenience,
imagine that we are building a binary tree, where the root of the tree
corresponds to the interval <span class='math'>$[1, N]$</span> and its minimum/sum, the leaves of the
trees are all intervals of the form <span class='math'>$[i, i]$</span> with their minima/sums, and the
left and right children of interval <span class='math'>$[a, b]$</span> are <span class='math'>$[a, c]$</span> and <span class='math'>$[c+1, b]$</span>
respectively.
<p>Given the minimum for intervals <span class='math'>$[a, c]$</span> and <span class='math'>$[c+1, b]$</span>, the minimum in the
interval <span class='math'>$[a, b]$</span> is just the minimum of those two. By similar logic, the sum
for interval <span class='math'>$[a, b]$</span> is the sum for intervals <span class='math'>$[a, c]$</span> and <span class='math'>$[c+1, b]$</span>.
<p>We will now describe in detail how to support the first operation - the second
operation is supported with very similar logic.
<p>Given an interval <span class='math'>$[l, r]$</span> for which we want to compute the minimum number in
that interval, generically consider how a specific interval in the tree can help
us answer the first query. If the interval in that node is strictly inside our
interval, then the minimum for that interval is a &quot;candidate&quot; for the minimum
number in that interval and we don&apos;t need to inspect its children. If the
interval in that node is strictly outside that interval, then we ignore that
interval. Otherwise, we need to recursively look at the two children of the
interval. When we are done searching through the tree, we just return the
minimum candidate.
<p>If we start this process from the root, each level of the tree can contribute a
maximum of two candidates and we can only recurse to a lower level of the tree
from two other nodes. If three candidates could be found from a given level of
the tree, then two of those candidates would have to have a common parent and we
could have short-circuited the analysis by inspecting just that interval.
Similarly, the nodes where we would recurse to a lower level have to be directly
to the left or the right of a valid candidate. Therefore, we only inspect
<span class='math'>$O(\log N)$</span> nodes, as desired.
<p>The second operation works in essentially the same way, except we sum the
&quot;candidates&quot;.
<p>It remains to support the third operation. If we naively update this data
structure by updating every relevant node, since there are <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> intervals,
this would run in O(N) time and be no better than the naive solution of
maintaining just the list of elements.
<p>To get around this, we add another piece of information to the interval along
with the minimum and the sum - the &quot;increment&quot;, which is initialized to zero for
every interval. We will maintain the invariant that if the increment of a given
interval is <span class='math'>$K$</span>, then we need to increment every number in that interval by <span class='math'>$K$</span>.
These increments stack with each other, so if interval <span class='math'>$[1, 2]$</span> has an increment
of 2 and interval <span class='math'>$[1, 4]$</span> has an increment of 3, then the numbers in the
interval <span class='math'>$[1, 2]$</span> actually need to be incremented by 5.
<p>To increment every number in a range <span class='math'>$[l, r]$</span> by K, start the same process of
walking from the root down to the leaves of the tree. If we look at an interval
which is outside <span class='math'>$[l, r]$</span>, then we can ignore it. If the interval partially
overlaps with <span class='math'>$[l, r]$</span>, we have to recursively inspect the interval&apos;s children.
If the interval is strictly inside the interval, then increase the increment by
<span class='math'>$K$</span> and stop there. The interesting case is when the interval partially overlaps
with other intervals.
<p>In this case, the given interval may have an increment that was requested
earlier that needs to be applied to every number in the interval. In this
situation, we will &quot;increment&quot; every number in that interval by incrementing
every number in the two children by the given increment, and then set the
increment in our current interval to zero. After that, we will recursively apply
the current increment that was requested by recursing on the two children.
Finally, to keep the data structure accurate, we will then look at the children
to update the minimum and sum for the current interval.
<p>The first two operations do not change significantly now that we must support
the third operation - the major difference is that if we need to recursively
inspect both children, we need to apply the increment to the two children and
then update the current interval again.
<p>By the same logic as in the analysis of the first operation, the third operation
only inspects <span class='math'>$O(\log N)$</span> nodes and therefore runs in <span class='math'>$O(\log N)$</span> time.
<p>This data structure is known as a range tree with lazy propagation. We call it a
range tree because each node in the tree stores information about a range of the
underlying list, and the lazy propagation part comes in because when we request
an update to the list (in this case an increase of an interval over the tree),
we update as few nodes as possible while still keeping track of the need to
update more nodes.
<p>Here is my implementation of this data structure.
