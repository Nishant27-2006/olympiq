(Analysis by Dhruv Rohatgi)
<p>A first observation is that if some cow never receives a gift, then her rank in
the queue (that is, the number of cows ahead of her in the queue) never
increases. This has several consequences. First, none of the cows after her can
receive a gift, since it&apos;s impossible for one cow to actively ``overtake&quot;
another. So the set of cows who never receive gifts actually forms a suffix of
the list of cows, and our problem is to find the length of this suffix.
<p>Consider the first cow who never receives a gift. Her rank never reaches <span class='math'>$0$</span>. So
after a sufficiently long time, she will attain some minimum rank <span class='math'>$k$</span>. By our
previous observation, she will remain at this rank forever. It follows that no
cow in front of her will jump behind her upon reaching the head of the queue.
But every cow in front of her reaches the head at some point, since she is by
choice the first cow to not reach the head. Thus all <span class='math'>$k$</span> cows in front of her
have skipping number at least <span class='math'>$N-k$</span>. Rephrasing skipping numbers in terms of
ranks, all <span class='math'>$k$</span> cows in front of her jump to ranks at most <span class='math'>$k$</span>. In the original
permutation of cows, these <span class='math'>$k$</span> cows (and possibly some other cows) must already
have been ahead of her, since ``overtaking&quot; cannot happen.
<p>So for any cow who never receives a gift, there is some positive integer <span class='math'>$k$</span>
such that there are <span class='math'>$k$</span> cows ahead of her with ``jumping numbers&quot; at most <span class='math'>$k$</span>.
It turns out that this condition is also sufficient for a cow to not receive a
gift. Suppose that there is a cow who receives a gift (call her Moomoo), but who
is preceded by <span class='math'>$k$</span> cows with jumping numbers at most <span class='math'>$k$</span>. We claim by induction
that at every timestep, Moomoo is preceded by <span class='math'>$k$</span> cows with jumping numbers at
most <span class='math'>$k$</span>. To see this, suppose one of these <span class='math'>$k$</span> cows has reached the head of the
queue. This cow will jump to a rank at most <span class='math'>$k$</span>. But Moomoo&apos;s rank is at least
<span class='math'>$k$</span>, by our inductive hypothesis. So the jumping cow will remain in front of
Moomoo. By induction, Moomoo never reaches the head of the queue (and in
particular, never has rank less than <span class='math'>$k$</span>).
<p>So now we simply need to find the first cow for whom there is some positive
integer <span class='math'>$k$</span> such that there are <span class='math'>$k$</span> cows ahead of her with ``jumping numbers&quot; at
most <span class='math'>$k$</span>, where the jumping number of cow <span class='math'>$i$</span> is simply <span class='math'>$N - c_i$</span>. This can be
done in <span class='math'>$O(N \log N)$</span> time: binary search for the first such cow. To check if a
given cow satisfies the condition, compute for each <span class='math'>$k$</span> the number of cows in
front of the given cow with number at exactly <span class='math'>$k$</span>, and then check for each <span class='math'>$k$</span>
if the <span class='math'>$k^\text{th}$</span> partial sum is at least <span class='math'>$k$</span>.
<p>Below is Travis Hance&apos;s solution implementing this idea.
