(Analysis by Mark Gordon)
<p>A simple way to approach this problem would be to consider all ranges of the input array
and determine the largest number that can be produced in that range.  However, most ranges
aren&apos;t actually interesting as they could never be combined into one.
<p>To see this it helps to look at the equivalent problem where each of the array elements are powers of two
and instead of combining x and x to produce x + 1 you produced 2x.  Now it&apos;s clear that a range
must sum to a power of two to be interesting.  In fact, an interesting range can be better
described by its starting position and the power of two it sums to.
<p>This informs a simple Dynamic Programming solution.  We let DP[p][i] give the ending index of the range starting
at i that can combine to p, or -1 if it doesn&apos;t exist.  DP[p + 1][i] is then calculated as
DP[p + 1][i] = DP[p][DP[p][i]] provided DP[p][i] is valid.
<p>Here&apos;s my solution to this problem.
<p><pre class='prettyprint'>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

using namespace std;

#define MAXN ((1 &lt;&lt; 18) + 10)
#define MAXSZ 70

int dp[MAXSZ + 1][MAXN];
int A[MAXN];

int main() {
  int N; cin &gt;&gt; N;

  vector&lt;int&gt; A(N);
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
    cin &gt;&gt; A[i];
  }

  int result = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt;= MAXSZ; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; N; j++) {
      if (A[j] == i) {
        dp[i][j] = j + 1;
        result = max(result, i);
      } else {
        if (i == 0 || dp[i - 1][j] == -1 || dp[i - 1][dp[i - 1][j]] == -1) {
          dp[i][j] = -1;
        } else {
          dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][dp[i - 1][j]];
          result = max(result, i);
        }
      }
    }
    dp[i][N] = -1;
  }
  cout &lt;&lt; result &lt;&lt; endl;

  return 0;

<p><b>Further analysis contributed by Kyle Liu:</b> There is an
alternative $O(N)$ greedy approach. An $O(N \log N)$ greedy solution is
obvious. We can remove the lowest value ($M$) by greedily combining $K$
consecutive pairs of $M$ into $K/2$ pairs of ($M+1$). In case that $K$ is odd,
we can simply break the sequence into two and assign the $K/2$ pairs of
$M+1$ to both sequences. Repeating this process will give us an $O(N \log N)$
solution, using appropriate data structures.

<p> $O(N)$ can be achieved since we don't have to always find lowest value
to remove. Consider the sequence of numbers as heights of hills. We
can simply find the "valley points" (point whose heights are below its
neighbours') to remove. We first condense the sequence into
consecutive intervals of same heights. We use a stack to keep track of
the sequence and "valley point". As we go through the list of
intervals, if the stack is empty or the incoming height is below the
height in the top of stack (downhill), we simply push the incoming
interval to the stack. If the incoming height is above the height in
the top of stack (uphill), the point at the top of the stack is a
"valley point", and it needs to be removed by combining into its
neighbouring intervals. Its left neighbours are in the stack and its
right neighbour is the incoming interval. If any combination needs to
break into two sequences. We can calculate the optimal value of the
first sequence by "collapsing" the stack. We then start the second
sequence with only the "valley point" in the stack. 

<p> Here is my code implementing this approach:

<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

using namespace std;

#define MAXN 262144+10

struct Node {
	int val;
	int tot;
};

Node ar[MAXN];
Node s[MAXN];
int N, top = 0, res = 0;

void collapse_stack(void) // calculate value for first squence and reset stack
{
	for (; top &gt; 1; top--) 
		s[top-2].tot += s[top-1].tot / (1 &lt;&lt; (s[top-2].val - s[top-1].val));
	res = max(res, s[top-1].val + (int)log2(s[top-1].tot));
	top--;
}

void combine_left(int val) // combine the left side until height reaches val
{
	for (; top &gt; 1; top--) {
		if(s[top-2].val &gt; val) break;
		int num = 1 &lt;&lt; (s[top-2].val - s[top-1].val);
		if (s[top-1].tot % num) {
			Node tmp = s[top-1];
			collapse_stack();
			s[top++] = tmp; // start second sequence with the "valley point"
			break;
		}
		s[top-2].tot += s[top-1].tot / num;
	}
}

int main(void)
{
	freopen("262144.in","r",stdin);
	freopen("262144.out","w",stdout);
	cin &gt;&gt; N;
	
	int st = 0;
	for(int i=1; i&lt;=N; i++) {
		int a;
		cin &gt;&gt; a;
		res = max(res, a);
		if(a == ar[st].val) ar[st].tot++;
		else {
			ar[++st].val = a;
			ar[st].tot++;
		}
	}
	
	for(int i=1; i&lt;=st; i++) {
		if (top == 0 || (ar[i].val &lt; s[top-1].val)) { // downhill, add to stack
			s[top++] = ar[i];
			continue;
		}
		combine_left(ar[i].val);
		int num = 1 &lt;&lt; (ar[i].val - s[top-1].val); 
		if (s[top-1].tot % num == 0) { // combine new interval into stack
  			s[top-1].val = ar[i].val;
  			s[top-1].tot = ar[i].tot + s[top-1].tot / num;
   		}
   		else { // new intervals cannot be merged to intervals already in stack
			ar[i].tot += s[top-1].tot / num;
			collapse_stack();
			s[top++] = ar[i];
		}
	}		
	collapse_stack(); // obtain answer for remaining intervals in stack
	cout &lt;&lt; res &lt;&lt; endl;
	return 0;
}
