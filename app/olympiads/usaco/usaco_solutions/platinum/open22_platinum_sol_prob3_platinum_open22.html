(Analysis by Danny Mittal)
<p>We will refer to the string of Us and Ds as <span class='math'>$s$</span>.
<p><strong>Subtask 1: <span class='math'>$N \leq 500$</span></strong>
<p>We can do DP. For each triple <span class='math'>$(j, k, u)$</span>, our DP says whether there exists a
subsequence of <span class='math'>$p_1, \ldots, p_k$</span> consistent with <span class='math'>$s_1\ldots s_j$</span> that ends in
the number <span class='math'>$u$</span>. Transitions are constant time, so the runtime is
<span class='math'>$\mathcal O(N^3)$</span>.
<p><strong>Subtask 2: <span class='math'>$N \leq 5000$</span></strong>
<p>We can improve the DP from the previous subtask by noting that depending on
whether <span class='math'>$s_{j + 1}$</span> is U or D, it&apos;s optimal for the previous number in the
subsequence to be as small or as large as possible. Therefore, our DP should
find for each pair <span class='math'>$(j, k)$</span> both the smallest and the largest numbers such that
there exists a subsequence of <span class='math'>$p_1, \ldots, p_k$</span> consistent with <span class='math'>$s_1\ldots s_j$</span>
that ends in that number. Transitions are again constant time, so the runtime is
<span class='math'>$\mathcal O(N^2)$</span>.
<p><strong>Subtask 3: <span class='math'>$s$</span> is Us followed by Ds</strong>
<p>Apply a standard LIS algorithm to find for each number the longest LIS ending in
that number, as well as the longest LIS ending in that number that goes in
reverse (starting from the end of <span class='math'>$p$</span>). Now let the number of Us in <span class='math'>$s$</span> be <span class='math'>$j$</span>.
If there is no LIS of <span class='math'>$p$</span> with <span class='math'>$j + 1$</span>, then we simply use the longest LIS that
we found. Otherwise, find the first position in <span class='math'>$p$</span> where we have an LIS of
length <span class='math'>$j + 1$</span>, then use the longest reverse LIS that ends at or after that
position to compute the answer.
<p>The runtime is <span class='math'>$O(N\lg N)$</span> using an appropriate LIS algorithm.
<p><strong>Subtask 4: No additional constraints</strong>
<p>Intuitively, it makes sense for us to try to find the fastest (ending the
earliest) subsequence of <span class='math'>$p$</span> consistent with each prefix of <span class='math'>$s$</span>, and build on
that subsequence to find the fastest subsequence for the next prefix of <span class='math'>$s$</span>.
Unfortunately, this idea doesn&apos;t even work for normal LIS (longest increasing
subsequence), i. e. the case where <span class='math'>$s$</span> is UUUU..., because we can have a case
like
<p><span class='math'>$p = [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]$</span>
<p>where the fastest increasing subsequence of length <span class='math'>$3$</span> is <span class='math'>$[5, 6, 7]$</span>, but the
fastest one of length <span class='math'>$4$</span> is <span class='math'>$[1, 2, 3, 4]$</span> which doesn&apos;t build on <span class='math'>$[5, 6, 7]$</span>
at all.
<p>However, it turns out that we can actually apply this idea when switching from
contiguous segments of U to contiguous segments of D and vice versa.
Specifically, suppose that <span class='math'>$s_j$</span> is D, and the next <span class='math'>$x$</span> letters in <span class='math'>$s$</span> are U. If
the fastest subsequence <span class='math'>$a$</span> of <span class='math'>$p$</span> consistent with <span class='math'>$s_1\ldots s_j$</span> ends at index
<span class='math'>$k$</span>, then consider finding the fastest LIS <span class='math'>$b$</span> of length <span class='math'>$x + 1$</span> in <span class='math'>$p$</span>
considering only positions from <span class='math'>$k$</span> onwards. Say that <span class='math'>$b$</span> ends at position
<span class='math'>$k&apos;$</span>.
<p>It&apos;s clear that the fastest subsequence of <span class='math'>$p$</span> consistent with
<span class='math'>$s_1\ldots s_{j + x}$</span> must end at or after position <span class='math'>$k&apos;$</span>, because clearly it&apos;s
not possible to find a subsequence consistent with <span class='math'>$s_1\ldots s_j$</span> then an LIS
of length <span class='math'>$x + 1$</span> that starts with the previous subsequence prior to <span class='math'>$k&apos;$</span>.
<p>However, we can actually use <span class='math'>$a$</span> and <span class='math'>$b$</span> to create a subsequence consistent with
<span class='math'>$s_1\ldots s_{j + x}$</span> that ends at position <span class='math'>$k&apos;$</span>. If the last number <span class='math'>$a_{j}$</span> in
<span class='math'>$a$</span> and the first number <span class='math'>$b_0$</span> in <span class='math'>$b$</span> are the same, then we&apos;re done, because we
can simply attach them at that number. Otherwise, note that it can&apos;t be that
<span class='math'>$a_{j} &lt; b_0$</span>, because otherwise we could add <span class='math'>$a_{j}$</span> to the beginning of <span class='math'>$b$</span>
and remove <span class='math'>$b$</span>&apos;s last element to get an LIS of length <span class='math'>$x + 1$</span> that ends earlier.
Therefore, it must be that <span class='math'>$a_{j} &gt; b_0$</span>. However, since <span class='math'>$s_j$</span> is D, we can
actually take <span class='math'>$a$</span>, remove <span class='math'>$a_{j}$</span>, then add on <span class='math'>$b_0$</span>, which is valid because
<span class='math'>$a_{j-1} &gt; a_{j} &gt; b_1$</span> so the D is still satisfied, and now use <span class='math'>$b_0$</span> to glue
together <span class='math'>$a$</span> and <span class='math'>$b$</span>.
<p>Therefore, the end position of the fastest subsequence of <span class='math'>$p$</span> consistent with
<span class='math'>$s_1\ldots s_{j + x}$</span> is simply the end position of the fastest LIS of <span class='math'>$p$</span>
considering only positions starting from the end position of the fastest
subsequence consistent with <span class='math'>$s_1\ldots s_j$</span>. All of this also applies when U and
D are switched.
<p>This means that our algorithm can work as follows. We divide <span class='math'>$s$</span> into its
contiguous segments of U and D, and for each segment find the fastest LIS or LDS
of the length of the segment <span class='math'>$ + 1$</span> that only considers the part of <span class='math'>$p$</span> starting
(inclusive) from the end of the previous LDS or LIS. We finish when we are
unable to find an LIS or LDS of the appropriate length for some segment and
simply use the longest one we were able to find for that last segment to compute
the answer.
<p>To find LISs and LDSs, we can simply apply one of the standard algorithms for
finding LIS, but we have to be careful that the algorithm we use runs in time a
function of the number of elements we consider, not a function of <span class='math'>$N$</span>, as there
can potentially be many segments in <span class='math'>$s$</span>. An elegant choice given this constraint
is the binary search tree algorithm for LIS, which is used in the Java code
below.
<p>Assuming our LIS algorithm runs in <span class='math'>$\mathcal O(x\lg x)$</span> where <span class='math'>$x$</span> is the number
of elements we consider, the runtime of our overall algorithm is
<span class='math'>$\mathcal O(N\lg N)$</span>.
