(Analysis by Ethan Guo)
<p>Clearly, Bessie may send an invitation to any individual cow. To gain intuition
on how to maximize probability, we will investigate on what circumstances we
should extend an interval to increase probability. We will then show the
strategy works in general.
<p>Firstly, we will create an expression for the probability of exactly one
acceptance. This equals
<span class='math'>$\sum\limits_{l\leq i\leq r}\left(p_i\prod\limits_{l\leq j\leq r,j\neq i}(1-p_j)\right)$</span>.
Letting <span class='math'>$P=\prod\limits_{l\leq j\leq r}(1-p_j)$</span>, this expression reduces to
<span class='math'>$P\sum\limits_{l\leq i\leq r}\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}$</span>.
<p>Consider the expression after a probability <span class='math'>$pâ$</span> is added to an end of the
interval. For this to increase the answer, we have that
<span class='math'>$P(1-pâ)\left(\frac{pâ}{1-pâ}+\sum\limits_{l\leq i\leq r}\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\right)&gt;P\sum\limits_{l\leq i\leq r}\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}$</span>.
This, surprisingly, reduces to <span class='math'>$\sum\limits_{l\leq i\leq r}\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}&lt;1$</span>.
Therefore, as long as the sum of <span class='math'>$\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}$</span> within the interval is less
than <span class='math'>$1$</span>, it is desirable to extend the interval.
<p>Note that the quantity <span class='math'>$\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}$</span> for any probability is positive.
Therefore, each time we extend an interval, we increase <span class='math'>$\sum\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}$</span>.
Up to a given point, this sum will remain less than <span class='math'>$1$</span>, and each augmentation
before then is optimal to maximize the answer.
<p>Since we can always extend the interval as long as the condition is satisfied,
the correct strategy is to consider the maximal interval subject to the
constraint for each starting point. This can be done with the two-pointer method
in <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> since the right end of the maximal interval is nondecreasing (advance
the right pointer as long as the sum is still less than <span class='math'>$1$</span>, then advance the
left pointer once to consider the next starting point).  My solution code is
shown below.
<p>(Note from Brian Dean: this problem is related to the so-called &quot;Odds
Algorithm&quot;, for those who want to understand more about its underlying
mathematical structure)
