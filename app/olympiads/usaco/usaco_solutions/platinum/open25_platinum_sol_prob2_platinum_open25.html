(Analysis by Suhas Nagar)
<p>In order for the final array to be equivalent to the result of sorting the first
array, we know that there are two implicit conditions that must be true. 
<ul><li>The final array must be in sorted order</li><li>The elements in the final
array must be the same as the elements in the starting array</li></ul>
<p>The first condition is guaranteed regardless of the specific values. If this
were not true, this  would imply that at the end of the lazy sort process, there
exists some index <span class='math'>$i &lt; N-1$</span> where  <span class='math'>$a_i &gt; a_{i+1}$</span>, but if this were true, the
lazy sort process would still continue forming a contradiction.
<p>Thus the second condition is the only necessary one, so we need to determine how
this condition restricts our array. Suppose a cow holding <span class='math'>$A$</span> boxes hands a box
to a cow with <span class='math'>$B$</span> boxes during the lazy sort process. There are two cases for
what can happen.
<p><strong>Case 1: <span class='math'>$B = A-1$</span>: </strong> In this case, the transaction can be viewed as a
swap, meaning that the elements of the array after this swap will be the same as
it was before, so we can call this type of transaction idempotent.
<p><strong>Case 2: <span class='math'>$B &lt; A-1$</span>: </strong> In this case, the value <span class='math'>$A$</span> becomes <span class='math'>$A-1 \neq B$</span> and
the value <span class='math'>$B$</span> becomes <span class='math'>$B+1 \neq A$</span>. Since we have &quot;lost&quot; an occurrence of <span class='math'>$A$</span>,
we must recover this value. The only way to recover this is to have a cow with
value <span class='math'>$A-1$</span> be donated to by a cow <span class='math'>$j$</span> with value  <span class='math'>$a_j \geq A+1$</span> (since the
transaction must not be idempotent) or to have a cow with value <span class='math'>$A+1$</span> donate to
another cow <span class='math'>$j$</span> with value <span class='math'>$a_j \leq A-1$</span>. In other words, to recover <span class='math'>$A$</span> we
must &quot;lose&quot; an occurrence of some value larger than <span class='math'>$A$</span>.  Inductively, we will
reach a point where there is no larger to value to recover the current one. This
means that if this case ever arises, the values in our array cannot be
preserved.
<p>More formally, a value can only be lost if at some point, <span class='math'>$a_i = k$</span> and
<span class='math'>$a_{i+1} \leq k-2$</span>.  This leads us to the condition that for all <span class='math'>$j &gt; i$</span>,
<span class='math'>$a_j \geq a_i-1$</span>.
<p>This condition also gives us a tight bound on the values that we can fill the
array with. Since the last element of our sequence is constrained to <span class='math'>$v_i$</span>, any
element <span class='math'>$a_j$</span> prior where <span class='math'>$j &lt; i$</span> must satisfy <span class='math'>$a_j \leq v_i+1$</span>.
<p><strong>Subtasks 1 and 2 (<span class='math'>$N \le 100$</span> and <span class='math'>$v_i \leq 10^6$</span>):</strong>
<p>For these subtasks, we can run dynamic programming. We can let <span class='math'>$dp[i][v]$</span> be the
number of ways to construct a sequence of length <span class='math'>$i$</span> where the maximum element
was <span class='math'>$v$</span>.
<p>For a given state <span class='math'>$dp[i][v]$</span>, there are two ways to transition to <span class='math'>$dp[i+1][v]$</span>
(by placing <span class='math'>$v-1$</span> or <span class='math'>$v$</span> at the next spot). Alternatively, we can place any
value <span class='math'>$k &gt; v$</span> to transition to  <span class='math'>$dp[i+1][k]$</span>. Here, we can treat the values that
Farmer John remembers as forced transitions. This is sufficient for subtask <span class='math'>$1$</span>
as our time complexity is <span class='math'>$O(N(\max v_i)^2)$</span>.
<p>To improve this to subtask <span class='math'>$2$</span>, we can use prefix sums to reduce the time
complexity to <span class='math'>$O(N\max v_i )$</span>.
<p><strong>Full Solution:</strong>
<p>The full credit solution will be described below, where subtasks award partial
credit based on how accelerated certain parts of the solution are. These will be
clearly indicated.
<p>Suppose we were only given the start and end values (<span class='math'>$Q = 2$</span>) and we wanted to
count the  number of ways to fill in the values in between. When we built the
array in subtask 1, we saw that if our maximum value placed so far was <span class='math'>$a_i$</span>,
every future element <span class='math'>$a_j$</span> where <span class='math'>$j &gt; i$</span> either satisfies <span class='math'>$a_j \geq a_i$</span> or
<span class='math'>$a_j = a_i-1$</span>. In other words, if <span class='math'>$a_j$</span> is not greater than or equal to <span class='math'>$a_i$</span>,
its value is deterministic from the previous elements.
<p>This leads us to the observation that we need to count the number of ways to
place some non-decreasing subsequence in our empty spaces, and the rest of the
elements will be filled in deterministically based on the placed elements. This
forms a bijection, since we can take any sequence that works, eliminate the
elements that are not prefix maximums, and we are left with a unique
non-decreasing subsequence.
<p>Suppose we have <span class='math'>$N$</span> empty spots and we want to use values from <span class='math'>$1$</span> to <span class='math'>$V$</span>. To
compute the number of non-decreasing subsequences of length <span class='math'>$k$</span> which we can
denote as <span class='math'>$NDS_k$</span>, we can use stars and bars. If we have <span class='math'>$k$</span> stars and <span class='math'>$V-1$</span>
bars, we can determine what numbers to use in our sequence, and there is a
unique ordering that is non-decreasing, so <span class='math'>$NDS_k = {k+V-1\choose k}$</span>.  This
means that we can count the total number of ways to place all subsequences in
our empty spaces by computing <span class='math'>$\sum_{k=0}^N {N \choose k}NDS_k$</span>.
<p>Now when <span class='math'>$Q &gt; 2$</span>, we can use the query constraints and count the ways to fill in
the  values in between.
<p>We can construct a <span class='math'>$Q\times 2$</span> array <span class='math'>$dp[i][j]$</span>. If <span class='math'>$j=1$</span> then that means the
first <span class='math'>$i$</span> cows ended using a value that was <span class='math'>$v_i+1$</span>, and otherwise the sequence
ends with <span class='math'>$v_i$</span>. This matters  because it is legal to use values <span class='math'>$v_i-1$</span> if we
are transitioning from <span class='math'>$dp[i][0]$</span> and it is illegal otherwise.
<p>Let <span class='math'>$arr_v[l]$</span> be the number of <span class='math'>$l$</span>-length non-decreasing subsequences that end
in <span class='math'>$v$</span> and <span class='math'>$arr_{&lt;v}[l]$</span> be the number of <span class='math'>$l$</span>-length non-decreasing subsequences
that end in <span class='math'>$&lt;v$</span>. Note that this is sufficient since computing sequences with
values from <span class='math'>$A$</span> to <span class='math'>$B$</span> can be transformed to computing sequences with values
from <span class='math'>$1$</span> to <span class='math'>$B-A+1$</span>.
<p>If we are trying to compute the dp recurrence for <span class='math'>$i+1$</span> then we can let
<span class='math'>$k = c_{i+1}-c_i-1$</span> and <span class='math'>$v = v_{i+1}-v_i+1$</span>.
<p>We have 4 different cases to consider:
<p><ul><li>
<span class='math'>$dp[i][0] \rightarrow dp[i+1][0]$</span>: In this case, we can use any values in 
<span class='math'>$[v_i-1,v_{i+1}]$</span>. We can define
<span class='math'>$s_{00} = \sum_{j=0}^k arr_{&lt;v+1}[j]*{k \choose j}$</span>
</li><li>
<span class='math'>$dp[i][0] \rightarrow dp[i+1][1]$</span>: In this case, we can use any values in 
<span class='math'>$[v_i-1,v_{i+1}+1]$</span> but we must use <span class='math'>$v_{i+1}+1$</span>. We can define
<span class='math'>$s_{01} = \sum_{j=0}^k arr_{v+1}[j]*{k \choose j}$</span>
</li><li>
<span class='math'>$dp[i][1] \rightarrow dp[i+1][0]$</span>: In this case, we can use any values in 
<span class='math'>$[v_i,v_{i+1}]$</span>. We can define
<span class='math'>$s_{10} = \sum_{j=0}^k arr_{&lt;v}[j]*{k \choose j}$</span>
</li><li>
<span class='math'>$dp[i][1] \rightarrow dp[i+1][1]$</span>: In this case, we can use any values in 
<span class='math'>$[v_i,v_{i+1}+1]$</span> but we must use <span class='math'>$v_{i+1}+1$</span>. We can define
<span class='math'>$s_{11} = \sum_{j=0}^k arr_{v}[j]*{k \choose j}$</span>
</li></ul>
<p>However, in certain cases, some of these transitions are combined into others.
For example, if <span class='math'>$v = 0$</span> then <span class='math'>$s_{01} = s_{01}+s_{11}+s_{10}$</span> and
<span class='math'>$s_{11} = s_{10} = s_{00} = 0$</span>. This is because we must transition into a state
where our running max is <span class='math'>$v_{i+1}+1$</span>.
<p>Similarly, if <span class='math'>$v=1$</span>, then any <span class='math'>$1 \rightarrow 0$</span> transition is a
<span class='math'>$1 \rightarrow 1$</span> transition so <span class='math'>$s_{11} = s_{11} + s_{10}$</span> and <span class='math'>$s_{10} = 0$</span>.
<p>From here, our transitions are the following:
<div class='math'>$$dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]*s_{00}+dp[i][1]*s_{10}$$</div>
<div class='math'>$$dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][0]*s_{01}+dp[i][1]*s_{11}$$</div>
<p>To get full credit on subtask 3, we can precompute factorials and inverse
factorials up to <span class='math'>$10^6$</span> and compute all of the values directly.
<p>For future subtasks, since values can go up to <span class='math'>$10^9$</span>, we need to exploit the
iterative nature of our calculation. Since we perform stars and bars where the
number of  stars increases from <span class='math'>$0$</span>, we will always be computing some
<span class='math'>${n \choose k}$</span> after computing <span class='math'>${n-1 \choose k-1}$</span>. This means we can build the
following recurrence:
<div class='math'>$${n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} \cdot \frac{n}{k} = {n-1\choose k-1}\cdot (n) \cdot \text{modInv}(k)$$</div>
<p>This means we only need to compute modular inverses for the bound on <span class='math'>$k$</span>, which
is bounded by <span class='math'>$N$</span> and thus precomputable. Depending on your implementation, this
precomputation might be too slow and only pass up to subtask 4. Suppose we have
the following pseudocode:
<pre class='prettyprint'>
for i in N:
    inverseFactorial[i] = modularInverse(i)*inverseFactorial[i-1]
</pre>
With Euclidean Algorithm modular inverse code, this would take <span class='math'>$N\log MOD$</span> to
compute which can be very expensive. Instead, we can utilize the
<a href='https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/module-inverse.html#finding-the-modular-inverse-for-prime-moduli-using-euclidean-division'>
following equation</a> to compute these modular inverses in <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> instead. With
all of these optimizations, a full credit solution of <span class='math'>$O(N)$</span> is possible.
