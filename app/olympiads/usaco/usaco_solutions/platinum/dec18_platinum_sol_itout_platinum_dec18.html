(Analysis by  Spencer Compton )
<p>Let&apos;s think about what happens to our list of cows as FJ continues to yell
our chosen subset. Every time a cow chooses to swap position with an
adjacent cow, the number of inversions in our list decreases by exactly
one. This shows us that eventually the process must stop. 
<p>What can we say about our list of cows when the process finishes? We can be
certain that no two adjacent cows are both in our subset and in the wrong 
order. Otherwise, we would simply swap their positions with another iteration
of the process. Another thing we know is that all cows not in our set
have the same relative order as they originally did. This is because no two 
such cows will ever swap positions. It&apos;s then clear that it is necessary for 
all cows not in our set to make an increasing subsequence in our original list. 
<p>Now we think about what we can say about the final state of our list when the
complement of our set forms an increasing subsequence. We already know any
two adjacent cows in our set will be in the correct order. From this, we can
conclude that any contiguous segment of cows that are all in our set must be
in the correct order. We can visualize the structure of our final array as
sorted segments of cows in our set with cows not in our set sandwiched between
these segments. With this visualization, it is easy to see that any of these
segments will have cows with IDs strictly in the range of the two cows not
in our set that sandwich the segment. We now see that any segment to the left
of another segment must have IDs that are all strictly smaller than the segment
to the right. It is now clear that all pairs of &quot;types&quot; of cows must be in order.
Meaning, any two cows that are in our set must be in the correct order, any two
cows not in our set must be in the correct order (by definition), and we can also
see that there won&apos;t be pair of a cow in our set and a cow not in our set that are
out of order. Thus, if the cows not in our set are an increasing subsequence then
eventually our list will be sorted.
<p>How do we choose the smallest set where its complement is an increasing sequence?
We choose a set where its complement is a Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS).
Finding the length of the LIS is a classic problem and can be done in <span class='math'>$O(N\log{N})$</span>
time. What about finding the <span class='math'>$K$</span>-th lexicographically smallest set? We use the 
complement of the <span class='math'>$K$</span>-th lexicographically largest LIS. 
<p>How do we find the <span class='math'>$K$</span>-th lexicographically largest LIS? Let <span class='math'>$lis[i]$</span> denote the
largest increasing subsequence starting with the cow who is at position <span class='math'>$i$</span>. Let
<span class='math'>$a[i]$</span> denote the ID of the cow at position <span class='math'>$i$</span>. To calculate <span class='math'>$lis[i]$</span> it is 
<span class='math'>$1 + lis[j]$</span> where <span class='math'>$j$</span> is the maximal <span class='math'>$lis[j]$</span> given <span class='math'>$i&lt;j$</span> and <span class='math'>$a[i] &lt; a[j]$</span>. This
can be calculated in a manner similar to computing LIS with a segment tree. From
this formulation, consider two cows at position <span class='math'>$i$</span> and <span class='math'>$j$</span> where <span class='math'>$i&lt;j$</span> and
<span class='math'>$lis[i]=lis[j]$</span>. 
<p>Now we will compute <span class='math'>$dp[i]$</span> which is the number of LIS that are of length <span class='math'>$lis[i]$</span>
and start at position <span class='math'>$i$</span>. We can see that <span class='math'>$dp[i]$</span> is equal to the sum of all <span class='math'>$dp[j]$</span>
where <span class='math'>$i&lt;j$</span>, <span class='math'>$a[i] &lt; a[j]$</span>, and <span class='math'>$lis[j] = lis[i]-1$</span>. To calculate <span class='math'>$dp[i]$</span> we can make
a separate segment tree for each group of elements that have the same value of <span class='math'>$lis[i]$</span>
and then calculate the answer using a sweep similar to that of calculating the LIS.
Note that <span class='math'>$dp[i]$</span> can be very large, so we will just store the minimum of <span class='math'>$dp[i]$</span> and 
<span class='math'>$K+1$</span> for the value held in each <span class='math'>$dp[i]$</span> and in our segment tree&apos;s nodes.
<p>Once we have all <span class='math'>$dp[i]$</span>, we just need to reconstruct the <span class='math'>$K$</span>-th largest LIS. To
determine the <span class='math'>$x$</span>-th element (0-indexed) of the LIS, we process nodes where <span class='math'>$lis[i] = $</span>
(length of the LIS) <span class='math'>$- x$</span> in decreasing order of ID. Let <span class='math'>$i$</span> be the position of the 
<span class='math'>$x-1$</span>-th element in the LIS we&apos;re building and let <span class='math'>$j$</span> be the position of the element
we are considering. We will ignore the element if <span class='math'>$j&lt;i$</span> or <span class='math'>$a[j] &lt; a[i]$</span>. Otherwise, 
if <span class='math'>$dp[j]&lt;K$</span>, then the <span class='math'>$K$</span>-th LIS does not use this element. We will subtract <span class='math'>$dp[j]$</span>
from <span class='math'>$K$</span> and continue. If <span class='math'>$dp[j] \geq K$</span> then we will use that element and continue
onto considering the <span class='math'>$X+1$</span>-th element of our LIS.
<p>Once we have computed the <span class='math'>$K$</span>-th lexicographically largest LIS we will simply take
its complement.
