(Analysis by  Spencer Compton )
<p>Let&apos;s think about the pairs of non-standard trails that Bessie could use to make
a good route. Consider the tree that consists of standard trails. We will think
of a non-standard trail&apos;s &quot;path&quot; as the path between its two corresponding nodes
in the aforementioned tree. If the two non-standard trails we are considering
have edge-disjoint paths, then it is not possible to create a simple cycle with 
them. However, if their paths do overlap, then we can create exactly one simple 
cycle.
<p>Now we have another problem, how do we count the pairs of non-standard trails
whose paths overlap? We will consider the tree to be arbitrarily rooted. Let 
a non-standard trail go from node <span class='math'>$A$</span> to node <span class='math'>$B$</span> through its lowest common 
ancestor (LCA) <span class='math'>$L$</span>. This is a somewhat difficult shape to  work with. What if
we decided to instead break each nonstandard path into the path from <span class='math'>$A$</span> to <span class='math'>$L$</span>
and the path from <span class='math'>$L$</span> to <span class='math'>$B$</span>, and then counted the number of paths that overlap?
With this method of counting, we may overcount. However, we can easily tell if
a pair will be overcounted. We see that a pair will be overcounted only when
both trails have paths that go through the same LCA and the two edges that
are connected to the LCA in their path are the same. We can then just find the
number of such pairs and remove this from our answer, as this allows us to
ignore the overcounting and work with paths of a very simple shape.
<p>Our problem is now simpler, we have paths that travel from some node to one of
its ancestors and we want to count the number of pairs that overlap. A similar,
more well-known problem is this but in the form of 1-dimensional line segments.
A segment in the form [<span class='math'>$A_i$</span>,<span class='math'>$B_i$</span>] would mean there was a line that started
at <span class='math'>$A_i$</span> and ended at <span class='math'>$B_i$</span>. We could solve it in the following manner. At the 
start of every segment subtract from your answer the number of segments that
began before it, while at the end of every segment add to your answer the
number of segments that began before the end of this segment. (Being slightly 
careful about pairs of segments that start/end in the same location).
<p>In the tree version, we can do the exact same thing. We can use precalculation
with a depth-first search to calculate the number of paths that start at an
ancestor of each node. Then for each path that goes from a node <span class='math'>$A$</span> to an 
ancestor <span class='math'>$B$</span>, we add (the number of paths that start at an ancestor of <span class='math'>$B$</span>) -
(the number of paths that start at an ancestor of <span class='math'>$A$</span>) to our answer. We are
careful not to overcount pairs that have the same lowest edge on their path.
<p>Below is Dhruv Rohatgi&apos;s implementation.
