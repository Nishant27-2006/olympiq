<p>Intuitively, the larger our rectangles are, the more likely they are to overlap
other rectangles. Since we want to maximize the number of rectangles that can
have been drawn first, we want as few overlaps as possible, since knowing that
two rectangles overlap means that one of them cannot possibly have been drawn
first. This means it is always to our advantage to assume, when we can, that an
overlap doesn&apos;t occur, and so we will try to assume that each rectangle is as
small as it can possibly be. In particular, for each rectangle of a certain
color, we will always assume that the leftmost grid square of that color is its
left border, the topmost grid square of that color is its top border, etc.
<p>Now that we know the bounds of our rectangles, it is very straightforward to
determine whether two rectangles overlap. But when two rectangles overlap, how
do we know which one can be on top? Can either of them be on top? Consider the
area formed when two rectangles of colors C and D overlap. Clearly it cannot
contain squares of both colors C and D. If it contains either C or D, then the
corresponding rectangle of that color must have been painted later. (Otherwise,
the later rectangle would have painted over the color that shows up.) If it
contains neither, then we can assume either rectangle was painted first, as we
have no way to tell the difference.
<p>This means that a rectangle R could have been painted first if, and only if,
there is no other rectangle S such that there&apos;s a grid square of color R within
the area of S.
<p>This problem might seem to call for a two-dimensional segment tree at this
point, but there&apos;s a significantly easier way. We can keep two-dimensional
<a href='href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum&quot;'>prefix sums</a> representing
the bounds of each rectangle to quickly compute, for any grid square, how many
rectangles have been drawn over that square. Once we&apos;ve done so, we iterate over
every grid square. If a certain color appears at that square, and we calculate
that two or more rectangles have been drawn at that square, then we &quot;invalidate&quot;
that color -- it cannot possibly have been drawn first, as it&apos;s showing up over
another rectangle.
<p>Below is Brian Dean&apos;s solution. At the top-left and bottom-right grid squares of
each rectangle, he increases the value of <span class='math'>$\texttt{P}$</span> at that square by 1, and
at the bottom-left and top-right squares, he decreases the value of <span class='math'>$\texttt{P}$</span>
by 1. Then he computes the array <span class='math'>$\texttt{A}$</span> as the prefix sums of that array.
Each value of <span class='math'>$\texttt{A}$</span> will also be equal to the number of rectangles
located at that point -- if you aren&apos;t sure why this is true, it&apos;s a good
exercise to work out for yourself.
