(Analysis by Travis Hance)
<p>Since <span class='math'>$K$</span> is very small and <span class='math'>$N$</span> can be very large, this suggests trying to find
a solution which is linear in <span class='math'>$N$</span> and possibly exponential in <span class='math'>$K$</span>. This suggests
a dynamic programming approach where we proceed one row at a time, building a
minimum spanning tree as we go. In general, this partially constructed MST will
be a forest, and we must keep track of which nodes are in the same component of
the forest. If two nodes are in the same component, we cannot add a <em>new</em>
edge which connects them; conversely, if two nodes are not in the same
component, then they must eventually be connected.
<p>For our first attempt, our DP state can be <span class='math'>$(i,r)$</span> where <span class='math'>$1 \le i \le N$</span> is the
row that we have built our forest up to, and <span class='math'>$r$</span> is a state which represents
which of the <span class='math'>$K$</span> nodes in this row are connected to each other by the partially
constructed tree. For each state, the value we will track will be the total
weight of the minimum forest in the first <span class='math'>$i$</span> rows such that:
<ul><li> the forest connects every node in the first <span class='math'>$i$</span> rows to at least one node
in row <span class='math'>$i$</span> </li><li> the nodes in row <span class='math'>$i$</span> are divided into components according
to <span class='math'>$r$</span> </li></ul>
And of course, we also track the total number of such forests with that exact
weight.
<p>One way to represent <span class='math'>$r$</span> is by a sequence of <span class='math'>$k$</span> integers, where each integer
represents a component. For example, <span class='math'>$[1,2,3,4,5,6]$</span> represents a row where all
nodes are in different components, and <span class='math'>$[1,1,1,1,1,1]$</span> represents a row where
each node is connected. After accounting for many of these states being
equivalent, and accounting for the fact that some, like <span class='math'>$[1,2,1,2]$</span> are
impossible (because the graph must be planar), we count a total of <span class='math'>$132$</span> states
for <span class='math'>$K=6$</span>. It is easiest to pre-compute all of these states before beginning the
DP. In general, the number of states are gives by the
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number'>Catalan sequence</a> <span class='math'>$C_K$</span>.
<p>To transition from one row to the other, we have to consider every possible
subset of edges between the two rows that we could include in the forest, then
consider how the state is transformed by those edges. This gives <span class='math'>$2^{2K-1}$</span>
possible ways to transition any state (there are <span class='math'>$N$</span> edges between two rows and
<span class='math'>$N-1$</span> edges in the next row). This row-by-row approach gives a runtime
<span class='math'>$O(NKC_K 2^{2K-1})$</span>.
<p>We can do better by not trying to transition the entire row at once. In fact,
this approach is not just quicker, but it is likely simpler, simply because
there are only a constant number of transitions fore each state. Our state is
now <span class='math'>$(i, j, r)$</span>, which now corresponds to the first <span class='math'>$i$</span> rows plus the leftmost
<span class='math'>$j$</span> nodes of row <span class='math'>$i+1$</span>. There are two ways to transition from <span class='math'>$(i, K, r)$</span> to
<span class='math'>$(i+1, 1, *)$</span> (there is one edge, which can choose to take or not), and there
are four ways to transition from <span class='math'>$(i, j, r)$</span> to <span class='math'>$(i, j+1, *)$</span> (there are two
edges to choose from). This gives a runtime of <span class='math'>$O(NKC_K)$</span>.
