(Analysis by Nathan Pinsker)

The naive solution for this problem would be to iterate over all possible

$\binom{n}{3}$

lots, then count the number of points that fall within each lot.
However, this solution takes

$O(n^4)$

time, which is a bit too slow.

Since

$n$

is fairly small, we need only improve this solution by a factor of

$n$

to get full credit. One way we can do this is by simplifying the last step,
where we count the number of points contained in each lot. Intuitively, a point
is contained within a lot if, and only if, it is directly "below" one line
making up the boundary of the lot and directly "above" another line. More
specifically, we can think of each lot as being divided up as in the following
picture:

This helps us because the number of points in the green triangle is equal to the
number of points below the top line, minus the number of points below the bottom
two lines. Since there are

$O(n^3)$

different possible lots but

$O(n^2)$

possible lines, this suggests a faster solution. For any line that can make up
one side of a lot, we can precompute the number of points below this line in

$O(n^2 \cdot n)$

time. We can then iterate over each possible lot as before.
However, we can now  compute the number of points faster than

$O(n)$

per lot: we do so
by iterating clockwise around the lines that make up the triangle. For each
line, we either add or subtract the number of points under the line, depending
on whether the line is a top or bottom edge of the triangle.

This subprocedure is

$O(1)$

, so the second iteration over all lots is

$O(n^3)$

as well. The algorithm as a whole is therefore also

$O(n^3)$

, which is fast
enough to receive full credit.
