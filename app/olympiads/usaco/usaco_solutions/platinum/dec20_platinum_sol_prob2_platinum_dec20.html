(Analysis by Danny Mittal)
<p><strong>Subtask 1</strong> (<span class='math'>$K \leq 5$</span>)
<p>We can do this via bitmask DP. Our states will be pairs <span class='math'>$(\mu, r)$</span> where <span class='math'>$\mu$</span>
is a bitmask of length <span class='math'>$K$</span> and <span class='math'>$r$</span> is a room. The bitmask <span class='math'>$\mu$</span> represents all
sequences of button presses such that iff the <span class='math'>$j$</span>th bit in <span class='math'>$\mu$</span> is on, Bessie
has pressed button <span class='math'>$j$</span> at least once and has not pressed any button with a
higher number than <span class='math'>$j$</span> since the last time she pressed button <span class='math'>$j$</span>. The state
<span class='math'>$(\mu, r)$</span> then represents all sequences of button presses and rooms beginning
in room <span class='math'>$s$</span> by pressing button <span class='math'>$b_s$</span>, ending in room <span class='math'>$r$</span>, and satisfying the
conditions to correspond to mask <span class='math'>$\mu$</span>.
<p>A transition in our DP is then moving to another (possibly the same) room as
well as pressing another button. Bessie can move to room <span class='math'>$râ$</span> iff there is an
edge from <span class='math'>$r$</span> to <span class='math'>$râ$</span>. Additionally, Bessie can press button <span class='math'>$j$</span> iff the <span class='math'>$j$</span>th
bit in the current mask <span class='math'>$\mu$</span> is off â otherwise, she would press button <span class='math'>$j$</span>
twice without pressing a button with a higher number in between.
<p>We then must also consider how pressing a button changes <span class='math'>$\mu$</span>. It clearly sets
the <span class='math'>$j$</span>th bit to be on. Additionally, all lower bits are set off now that a
higher button has been pressed. All higher bits are unaffected. It is important
to note that the way this modification works implies that we always increase the
numerical value of our bitmask when transitioning, meaning that there are no
circular relations in our DP and that we should consider bitmasks in order of
increasing numerical value.
<p>Our DP then has <span class='math'>$O(2^KN)$</span> states, from each of which we perform <span class='math'>$O(KN)$</span>
transitions, meaning that our DP runs in <span class='math'>$O(K2^KN^2)$</span>.
<p>To compute the answer for each query, we simply take the sum of the DP values of
<span class='math'>$(t, \mu)$</span> over all bitmasks <span class='math'>$\mu$</span> such that the <span class='math'>$b_t$</span>th bit is on and all lower
bits are off, as these correspond precisely to the sequences where we end by
pressing button <span class='math'>$b_t$</span>. This takes <span class='math'>$O(2^K)$</span> time, so that our final computations
take <span class='math'>$O(2^KQ)$</span> time overall and thus our overall solution takes
<span class='math'>$O(2^K(KN^2 + Q))$</span>.
<p><strong>Subtask 2</strong> (<span class='math'>$b_s = K - 1$</span> and <span class='math'>$b_t = K$</span> for each query)
<p>First note that as Bessie always presses button <span class='math'>$K$</span> at the end, she cannot press
button <span class='math'>$K$</span> before then, as there would be no higher button that she could press
in between (as button <span class='math'>$K$</span> is the highest button). This also means that she
cannot press button <span class='math'>$K - 1$</span> after the beginning as she could never press button
<span class='math'>$K$</span>, the only higher button. Thus, any sequence of button presses that Bessie
takes, excluding the first and last button, uses buttons with numbers at most
<span class='math'>$K - 2$</span>.
<p>We can then solve this using DP. <span class='math'>$dp_{a, b, x}$</span> will be the number of sequences
of rooms and button presses which start at room <span class='math'>$a$</span>, end at room <span class='math'>$b$</span>, and only
involve pressing buttons with numbers at most <span class='math'>$x$</span>. We can compute transitions as
follows. First, we add all of <span class='math'>$dp_{a, b, x - 1}$</span> to <span class='math'>$dp_{a, b, x}$</span>, as a
sequence only using buttons with numbers at most <span class='math'>$x - 1$</span> will clearly also only
use buttons with numbers at most <span class='math'>$x$</span>.
<p>We then consider the case where we do press button <span class='math'>$x$</span>. Note that as we never
press any higher buttons, we must only press button <span class='math'>$x$</span> once. Letâs then fix
the room <span class='math'>$r$</span> that Bessie is in when she presses button <span class='math'>$x$</span>, and consider in
isolation the part of the sequence before pressing button <span class='math'>$x$</span> (the left side)
and after pressing button <span class='math'>$x$</span> (the right side). The left side, if it is not
empty, starts at some room <span class='math'>$a$</span>, ends at some room <span class='math'>$b$</span> such that there is an edge
from <span class='math'>$b$</span> to <span class='math'>$r$</span>, and only presses buttons with number at most <span class='math'>$x - 1$</span>.
Similarly, the right side, if it is not empty, starts at some room <span class='math'>$c$</span> such that
there is an edge from <span class='math'>$r$</span> to <span class='math'>$c$</span>, ends at some room <span class='math'>$d$</span>, and only presses
buttons with number at most <span class='math'>$x - 1$</span>.
<p>The number of left sides is then <span class='math'>$dp_{a, b, x - 1}$</span> for each <span class='math'>$a, b$</span> and the
number of right sides is <span class='math'>$dp_{c, d, x - 1}$</span> for each <span class='math'>$c, d$</span>. We only care about
the endpoints <span class='math'>$a$</span> and <span class='math'>$d$</span>, so for each <span class='math'>$a$</span>, we compute the sum over all
<span class='math'>$dp_{a, b, x - 1}$</span> such that there is an edge from <span class='math'>$b$</span> to <span class='math'>$r$</span>, and similarly for
each <span class='math'>$d$</span>. Note that we should account for the left side possibly being empty by
adding <span class='math'>$1$</span> to our calculation for <span class='math'>$a = r$</span>, as in that case our overall left
endpoint will just be <span class='math'>$r$</span> (and similarly for the right side). Finally, for each
<span class='math'>$a, d$</span>, we can simply multiply these quantities together and add the result to
<span class='math'>$dp_{a, d, x}$</span>.
<p>Each of these three computations is <span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span>, so as we do them for each maximum
number <span class='math'>$x$</span> and âmiddleâ room <span class='math'>$r$</span>, our DP computation is <span class='math'>$O(N^3K)$</span> overall.
<p>Given this DP, for each query to compute the answer, given that we want to start
at room <span class='math'>$s$</span> and end at room <span class='math'>$t$</span>, we loop through all second rooms <span class='math'>$a$</span> (such that
there is an edge from <span class='math'>$s$</span> to <span class='math'>$a$</span>) and second-to-last rooms <span class='math'>$b$</span> (such that there
is an edge from <span class='math'>$b$</span> to <span class='math'>$t$</span>) and add <span class='math'>$dp_{a, b, K - 2}$</span> to our answer. This is
<span class='math'>$O(N^2)$</span> for each query, making our overall algorithm <span class='math'>$O(N^3K + QN^2)$</span>.
<p><strong>Subtask 3</strong> (<span class='math'>$N, K, Q \leq 20$</span>)
<p>We can solve this subtask by modifying our solution for the previous subtask.
First note that our constraints are now low enough to allow computing our
<span class='math'>$O(N^3K)$</span> DP for each query. Given this, we can simply modify our DP as follows.
<span class='math'>$dp_{a, b, k}$</span> will be defined as usual, except that <span class='math'>$a$</span> can also take a special
value <span class='math'>$\alpha$</span> which will indicate that we are counting sequences which start at
room <span class='math'>$s$</span> but must also start by pressing button <span class='math'>$b_s$</span>. Similarly, <span class='math'>$b$</span> can take a
special value <span class='math'>$\beta$</span> which will indicate that we are counting sequences which
end at room <span class='math'>$t$</span> but must also end by pressing button <span class='math'>$b_t$</span>.
<p>These special values <span class='math'>$\alpha$</span> and <span class='math'>$\beta$</span> then essentially function as normal
rooms during our DP. There are only two differences: ones is that in our above
loops through all <span class='math'>$a, b$</span> and <span class='math'>$c, d$</span>, the rooms <span class='math'>$b$</span> and <span class='math'>$c$</span> are not allowed to be
<span class='math'>$\alpha$</span> or <span class='math'>$\beta$</span> as that would lead to overcounting; the other is that we
must properly account for the left side being empty by also adding <span class='math'>$1$</span> to our
calculation for <span class='math'>$a = \alpha$</span> if we are currently at <span class='math'>$r = s$</span> and <span class='math'>$x = b_s$</span>, and
similarly for the right side.
<p>Our answer is then simply <span class='math'>$dp_{\alpha, \beta, K}$</span>. These modifications do not
affect the asymptotic runtime of our DP, but we do now do it for each query,
giving the overall algorithm a runtime of <span class='math'>$O(QN^3K)$</span>.
<p><strong>Subtask 4</strong> (original constraints)
<p>Our solution for this is essentially the same as for the previous subtask,
noting that we donât actually really need to compute this DP for each query.
We can compute this DP just once by, instead of having the two special values
<span class='math'>$\alpha$</span> and <span class='math'>$\beta$</span>, having values <span class='math'>$\alpha_j$</span> and <span class='math'>$\beta_j$</span> for each
<span class='math'>$1 \leq j \leq Q$</span> such that <span class='math'>$\alpha_j$</span> corresponds to <span class='math'>$(s, b_s)$</span> for the <span class='math'>$j$</span>th
query and <span class='math'>$\beta_j$</span> corresponds to <span class='math'>$(t, b_t)$</span> for the <span class='math'>$j$</span>th query. The answer to
the <span class='math'>$j$</span>th query is then <span class='math'>$dp_{\alpha_j, \beta_j, K}$</span>.
<p>Considering the additional states, the runtime of our algorithm is now
<span class='math'>$O(N(N + Q)^2K)$</span>, which is still fast enough.
