(Analysis by Brian Dean)
<p>Letting <span class='math'>$K = 10$</span> be the maximum amount of dirt in any cell, we can ultimately
solve  this problem using dynamic programming in <span class='math'>$O(NK)$</span> time, which runs in
less than 0.1 seconds on every test case.  However, it takes a number of
structural insights to get to this point.  There are several ways to attack this 
problem, many based on more advanced network flow techniques like min-cost flows,
which are perhaps slightly beyond the typical scope of USACO contests.  For 
simplicity, we focus here on a solution that only uses dynamic programming,
and no advanced flow techniques.  We may soon add extra detail from other 
solutions that use flow-based techniques, for completeness.

<p>For starters, it may help to review the <span class='math'>$O((NK)^2)$</span>
<a href='https://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_landscape.html'>solution</a> of the
earlier version of this problem, which appeared on the silver 2012 March USACO
contest.  As in that problem, we first unpack each array into a list of <span class='math'>$O(NK)$</span>
dirt locations.  For example, a landscape with heights 3,1,4,1 turns into the
sequence 0,0,0,1,2,2,2,2,3 (e.g., there are 4 units of dirt at position 2).  The
previous solution involved using an &quot;edit distance&quot; style DP algorithm to
transform the initial sequence of dirt locations into the target sequence in
quadratic time.  
<p>It will be convenient to visualize this as matching a set of points on a number
line, where the As represent locations of the source dirt and Bs are the target
dirt locations.  If we match an A with a B (at distance <span class='math'>$d$</span>), this costs <span class='math'>$dZ$</span>
and corresponds to moving a piece of dirt.  Unmatched As correspond to deletions
(cost <span class='math'>$Y$</span>) and unmatched Bs correspond to insertions (cost <span class='math'>$X$</span>). <br>

<br><img src="fig_landscape1.gif"/><br>

<p>It will be helpful to assume that we match all of the smaller set of points; for
example, if there are fewer As, we&apos;d like to assume that we want to match all
the As, leaving only Bs unmatched.  To do this, we set the cost of matching a
distance-<span class='math'>$d$</span> pair to be <span class='math'>$\min(dZ, X+Y)$</span>, reflecting now the possibility that the
matched pair might not be an actual move, but may instead be a &quot;teleport&quot; caused
by a delete plus an insert.  We can now assume that all elements of the smaller
set must be matched.

<p>A key structural property is that there always exists an optimal matching with 
a &quot;nesting&quot; structure, where pairings can nest but not &quot;cross&quot;.  This follows
from the fact that any set of crossing edges can be &quot;uncrossed&quot;, for example as
shown below, without  harming (increasing) the total cost of the matching.  By
doing this repeatedly, we can turn any optimal matching into an optimal matching
with no crossings. <br>

<br><img src="fig_landscape2.gif"/><br>

<p>Recall that the cost of a distance-<span class='math'>$d$</span> edge in the matching is <span class='math'>$\min(dZ, X+Y)$</span>.
If the cost is <span class='math'>$X+Y$</span>, we&apos;ll call the edge &quot;long&quot;; otherwise it is &quot;short&quot;.  We
can prove that cost doesn&apos;t increase by the uncrossing operation by breaking it
into three cases: (i) both p and q are short, (ii) one of p and q is long, (iii)
both p and q are long.  In all cases, you can easily show that the total cost
does not increase.  For example, in case (iii), edge s must also be long, so the
contribution before uncrossing is <span class='math'>$2(X+Y)$</span> and the contribution after is
<span class='math'>$X+Y+\min(dr, X+Y) \leq 2(X+Y)$</span>.
<p>Non-crossing implies also that underneath each edge must be the same number of 
As and Bs.  Assume for a moment (without loss of generality) that there are more
Bs than As,  so all As must be matched. In this case, if there are more As than
Bs underneath edge p as shown below, then one of the As would need to be matched
in a way that crosses p.  <br>

<br><img src="fig_landscape3.gif"/><br>

<p>Similarly, if there are more Bs than As underneath edge q, then one of them must
remain unmatched (since otherwise there would be a crossing, just as before),
and then we could decrease the length of edge q by linking with the unmatched B
inside the range, giving an  even more optimal solution (or at least, not a
worse solution).
<p>Let us now assign heights to our points, with successive As moving upward and Bs
moving downward: <br>

<br><img src="fig_landscape4.gif"/><br>

<p>The fact that the points underneath each edge must be balanced therefore implies
that we can decompose our problem and consider each height level independently.
This simplifies things quite a bit, since within any given height level we have
alternating As and Bs. Either we have the same number of As and Bs and  they are
all matched, or we have one excess element that is unmatched while the rest are
matched.  In this second case, one can show that an optimal solution will not
involve an edge across the unmatched element, so it further decomposes into a
prefix of balanced As and Bs (all matched to each-other), followed by the
unmatched element, followed by a suffix of balanced As and Bs, all matched: <br>

<br><img src="fig_landscape5.gif"/><br>

<p>We therefore have reduced our problem to: given an alternating set of points,
find the optimal way to match every balanced prefix (and by symmetry, suffix). 
We show how to do this in linear time with dynamic programming, after which
another linear-time scan can be used to find the right way to combine the two
solutions as in the &quot;one element unmatched&quot; case above.
<p>Our dynamic programming formulation looks like the following.  For each balanced
prefix (say, up to position <span class='math'>$j$</span>), we compute the optimal way to match all its
elements, and also the optimal way to match its elements such that  <span class='math'>$j$</span> is
matched with a long edge.  For matching element <span class='math'>$j$</span> with a long edge, candidates
to which we can match are those elements in regions <span class='math'>$R$</span> and <span class='math'>$S$</span> in the figure
below:<br>

<br><img src="fig_landscape6.gif"/><br>

<p>We can afford to check all the candidates in region <span class='math'>$S$</span> explicitly, since for
all values of <span class='math'>$j$</span> this will involve monotonically scanning the entire line just
once.  Each candidate <span class='math'>$i$</span> in <span class='math'>$S$</span> can be checked in <span class='math'>$O(1)$</span> time, since we have
already computed the best way to match everyone up to <span class='math'>$i-1$</span>, and  since the
elements underneath the long <span class='math'>$i$</span>-<span class='math'>$j$</span> edge can be assumed to be simply paired up
consecutively (so this cost can be computed in constant time using the
difference of two prefix sums).  This follows from the observation that an
optimal solution will never involve a long edge nested within another long
edge, so underneath any long edge we have only short edges; furthermore, nested
short edges can always be uncrossed with no change in objective value, so we can
assume the short edges underneath a long edge are just consecutively paired,
with no nesting at all. To evaluate candidates in the <span class='math'>$R$</span> region, we note that
the best such candidate is the same as the best long-edge match from element
<span class='math'>$j-2$</span>, the only difference being that its cost has increased by the additional
cost of pairing elements <span class='math'>$j-2$</span> and <span class='math'>$j-1$</span>.
<p>For matching element <span class='math'>$j$</span> with a short edge, we can assume (by the reasoning
above, since short edges don&apos;t nest), that <span class='math'>$j$</span> would be paired with <span class='math'>$j-1$</span>, so
this is easy to evaluate in <span class='math'>$O(1)$</span> time.  This completes the description of the
DP algorithm.
<p>My code is below.  The input part in the main function arranges elements by
level, then the solve() function runs independently within each level, calling
the DP code once or twice (twice if we need to combine a prefix and a suffix
solution, having to deal with an odd number of elements on some level).  The DP
code is a bit cryptic, but follows essentially the approach outlined above.
