(Analysis by  Dhruv Rohatgi )
<p>In this problem, we are given <span class='math'>$N$</span> intervals, and asked to find the maximum area
which they can cover if we remove exactly <span class='math'>$K$</span> of them.
<p>One immediate observation is that it&apos;s not a problem if we remove too many
intervals, since we can add them back without decreasing the total area. A
consequence of this is that if one interval is contained in another interval, we
may as well remove the first interval.
<p>So first we filter out intervals that are &quot;superseded&quot;. To do so, simply sort
the intervals by starting point and keep track of the maximum ending point seen
so far.
<p>Now we have some number of intervals which are monotonic; that is, if one
interval starts before another interval, it also ends before the other interval.
This suggests a left-to-right scan and dynamic programming.
<p>Index the intervals from <span class='math'>$1$</span> to <span class='math'>$N$</span> in left-to-right order. Let <span class='math'>$f(n,r)$</span> be the
maximum area which can be covered by the first <span class='math'>$n$</span> intervals after removing at
least <span class='math'>$r$</span> of these intervals, assuming that interval <span class='math'>$n$</span> is not removed. There
are three cases:
<p>1) Interval <span class='math'>$n$</span> is the only interval which we keep, out of the first <span class='math'>$n$</span>
intervals
<p>2) We keep the leftmost interval in <span class='math'>$1 \dots n-1$</span> that intersects with interval
<span class='math'>$n$</span>
<p>3) We do not keep any of the intervals in <span class='math'>$1 \dots n-1$</span> that intersect with
interval <span class='math'>$n$</span>.
<p>These three cases are the only possibilities: if interval <span class='math'>$j$</span> is the first
interval that intersects with interval <span class='math'>$n$</span>, there is no point in keeping any of
the subsequent intervals <span class='math'>$j+1, j+2, \dots, n-1$</span> (for essentially the same reason
we could discard &quot;superseded&quot; intervals).
<p>The first case is simple; it is possible if and only if <span class='math'>$r \leq n-1$</span>. The area
covered is the area of interval <span class='math'>$n$</span>.
<p>The second case is also relatively straightforward; if the leftmost interval
that intersects interval <span class='math'>$n$</span> is interval <span class='math'>$j$</span>, then the area covered is
<span class='math'>$f(j, r - (n-j-1))$</span> plus the area of interval <span class='math'>$n$</span>, minus the overlap between
intervals <span class='math'>$n$</span> and <span class='math'>$j$</span>.
<p>We keep track of the index <span class='math'>$j$</span> with the two pointers method. As we increase <span class='math'>$j$</span>,
we can maintain for each <span class='math'>$r$</span> the maximum area covered by the first <span class='math'>$j-1$</span>
intervals after removing exactly <span class='math'>$r$</span> of them. Since the intervals that do not
intersect interval <span class='math'>$n$</span> are exactly the first <span class='math'>$j-1$</span> intervals, this running
maximum allows us to deal with the third case efficiently as well.
<p>The number of states used is <span class='math'>$NK$</span>, and each transition is <span class='math'>$O(1)$</span>, so the time
complexity of our algorithm is <span class='math'>$O(NK)$</span>.
